It was formed on 1 November 1956 following the States Reorganisation Act\nby combining Malayalam\n-speaking regions. Spread over 38,863\u0026#160;km2\n(15,005\u0026#160;sq\u0026#160;mi), it is bordered by Karnataka\nto the north and northeast, Tamil Nadu\nto the east and south, and the Lakshadweep Sea\nto the west. With 33,387,677 inhabitants as per the 2011 Census\n, Kerala is the thirteenth-largest Indian state by population\n. It is divided into 14 districts\nwith the capital being Thiruvananthapuram\n. Thiruvananthapuram is the largest city in the state. Malayalam is the most widely spoken language and is also the official language of the state.","The Chera Dynasty\nwas the first prominent kingdom based in Kerala. The Ay kingdom\nin the deep south and the Ezhimala kingdom\nin the north formed the other kingdoms in the early years of the Common Era\n(CE or AD). The region had been a prominent spice exporter since 3000\u0026#160;BCE. The region's prominence in trade was noted in the works of Pliny\nas well as the Periplus\naround 100 CE. In the 15th century, the spice trade\nattracted Portuguese\ntraders to Kerala, and paved the way for European colonisation\nof India. At the time of Indian independence movement\nin the early 20th century, there were two major princely states\nin Kerala-Travancore State\nand the Kingdom of Cochin\n. They united to form the state of Thiru-Kochi\nin 1949. The Malabar region, in the northern part of Kerala had been a part of the Madras province\nof British India\n, which later became a part of the Madras State\npost-independence. After the States Reorganisation Act, 1956\n, the modern-day state of Kerala was formed by merging the Malabar district\nof Madras State (excluding Gudalur taluk\nof Nilgiris district\n, Topslip\n, the Attappadi\nForest east of Anakatti), the state of Thiru-Kochi (excluding four southern taluks of Kanyakumari district\n, Shenkottai and Tenkasi taluks), and the taluks of Kasaragod\n(now Kasaragod District\n) and South Kanara\n(Tulunad\n) which were a part of Madras State.","Kerala has the lowest positive population growth rate in India, 3.44%; the highest Human Development Index\n(HDI), 0.712 in 2015; the highest literacy rate, 93.91% in the 2011 census; the highest life expectancy, 77 years; and the highest sex ratio, 1,084 women per 1,000 men. The state has witnessed significant emigration, especially to Arab states of the Persian Gulf\nduring the Gulf Boom\nof the 1970s and early 1980s, and its economy depends significantly on remittances\nfrom a large Malayali\nexpatriate community. Hinduism\nis practised by more than half of the population, followed by Islam\nand Christianity\n. The culture is a synthesis of Aryan\n, Dravidian\n, Arab\n, European\ncultures,[6]\n\ndeveloped over millennia, under influences from other parts of India and abroad.","The production of pepper\nand natural rubber\ncontributes significantly to the total national output. In the agricultural sector, coconut\n, tea\n, coffee\n, cashew\nand spices are important. The state's coastline extends for 595 kilometres (370\u0026#160;mi), and around 1.1\u0026#160;million people in the state are dependent on the fishery industry which contributes 3% to the state's income. The state has the highest media exposure in India\nwith newspapers publishing in nine languages, mainly English and Malayalam. Kerala is one of the prominent tourist destinations\nof India, with backwaters\n, beaches, Ayurvedic tourism\nand tropical\ngreenery as its major attractions.","","","The name Kerala has an uncertain etymology. One popular theory derives Kerala\nfrom Kera\n(\"coconut tree\" in Malayalam) and alam\n(\"land\"); thus \"land of coconuts\",[7]\n\nwhich is a nickname for the state, used by locals, due to abundance of coconut trees.[8]\n\nThe word Kerala\nis first recorded as Keralaputra\nin a 3rd-century BCE rock inscription left by the Maurya emperor\nAshoka\n(274–237\u0026#160;BCE), one of his edicts\npertaining to welfare.[9]\n\nThe inscription refers to the local ruler as Keralaputra\n(Sanskrit for \"son of Kerala\"); or \"son of Chera[s]\". This contradicts the theory that Kera\nis from \"coconut tree\".[10]\n\nAt that time, one of three states in the region was called Cheralam\n\nin Classical Tamil: Chera\nand Kera\nare variants of the same word.[11]\n\nThe word Cheral\nrefers to the oldest known dynasty of Kerala kings and is derived from the Proto-Tamil-Malayalam word for \"lake\".[12]\n\n","The earliest Sanskrit text to mention Kerala is the Aitareya Aranyaka\nof the Rigveda\n. Kerala is also mentioned in the Ramayana\nand the Mahabharata\n, the two Hindu epics.[13]\n\nThe Skanda Purana\n\nmentions the ecclesiastical office of the Thachudaya Kaimal\nwho is referred to as Manikkam Keralar\n, synonymous with the deity of the Koodalmanikyam\ntemple.[14]\n\n[15]\n\nKeralam\nmay stem from the Classical Tamil\ncherive-alam\n(\"declivity of a hill or a mountain slope\")[16]\n\nor chera alam\n(\"Land of the Cheras\"). The Greco-Roman\ntrade map Periplus Maris Erythraei\n\nrefers to Keralaputra as Celobotra\n.[17]\n\n","According to Hindu\nmythology, the lands of Kerala were recovered from the sea by the axe-wielding warrior sage Parasurama\n, the sixth avatar\nof Vishnu\n(hence, Kerala is also called Parasurama Kshetram\n(\"The Land of Parasurama\")[18]\n\n). Parasurama threw his axe across the sea, and the water receded as far as it reached. According to legend, this new area of land extended from Gokarna\nto Kanyakumari\n.[19]\n\nThe land which rose from sea was filled with salt and unsuitable for habitation; so Parasurama invoked the Snake King Vasuki\n, who spat holy poison and converted the soil into fertile lush green land. Out of respect, Vasuki and all snakes were appointed as protectors and guardians of the land. The legend was later expanded, and found literary expression in the 17th or 18th century with Keralolpathi\n\n, which traces the origin of aspects of early Kerala society, such as land tenure and administration, to the story of Parasurama.[20]\n\nIn medieval times Kuttuvan\nmay have emulated the Parasurama tradition by throwing his spear into the sea to symbolise his lordship over it.[21]\n\n","Another much earlier Puranic\ncharacter associated with Kerala is Mahabali\n, an Asura\nand a prototypical just king, who ruled the earth from Kerala. He won the war against the Devas\n, driving them into exile. The Devas pleaded before Lord Vishnu\n, who took his fifth incarnation as Vamana\n\nand pushed Mahabali down to Patala\n(the netherworld) to placate the Devas. There is a belief that, once a year during the Onam\nfestival, Mahabali returns to Kerala.[22]\n\nThe Matsya Purana\n, among the oldest of the 18 Puranas\n,[23]\n\n[24]\n\nuses the Malaya Mountains\nof Kerala (and Tamil Nadu\n) as the setting for the story of Matsya\n, the first incarnation\nof Vishnu, and Manu\n, the first man and the king of the region.[25]\n\n[26]\n\n","A substantial portion of Kerala may have been under the sea in ancient times. Marine fossils have been found in an area near Changanacherry\n, thus supporting the hypothesis.[27]\n\nPre-historical archaeological findings include dolmens\nof the Neolithic\nera in the Marayur\narea of the Idukki district. They are locally known as \"muniyara\", derived from muni\n(hermit\nor sage\n) and ara\n(dolmen).[28]\n\nRock engravings in the Edakkal Caves\n, in Wayanad\ndate back to the Neolithic era around 6000\u0026#160;BCE.[29]\n\n[30]\n\nArchaeological studies have identified Mesolithic\n, Neolithic and Megalithic\nsites in Kerala.[31]\n\nThe studies point to the development of ancient Kerala society and its culture beginning from the Paleolithic Age\n, through the Mesolithic, Neolithic and Megalithic Ages.[32]\n\nForeign cultural contacts have assisted this cultural formation;[33]\n\nhistorians suggest a possible relationship with Indus Valley Civilization\nduring the late Bronze Age\nand early Iron Age\n.[34]\n\n","Kerala has been a major spice exporter since 3000\u0026#160;BCE, according to Sumerian records\nand it is still referred to as the \"Garden of Spices\" or as the \"Spice Garden of India\".[35]\n\n[36]\n\nKerala's spices attracted ancient Babylonians\n, Assyrians\nand Egyptians\nto the Malabar Coast in the 3rd and 2nd millennia BCE. Phoenicians\nestablished trade with Kerala during this period.[37]\n\nThe Land of Keralaputra\nwas one of the four independent kingdoms in southern India during Ashoka's time, the others being Chola\n, Pandya\n, and Satiyaputra\n.[38]\n\nScholars hold that Keralaputra is an alternate name of the Cheras\n, the first dominant dynasty based in Kerala.[39]\n\n[40]\n\nThese territories once shared a common language and culture, within an area known as Tamilakam\n.[41]\n\nAlong with the Ay kingdom\nin the south and the Ezhimala kingdom\nin the north, the Cheras\nformed the ruling kingdoms of Kerala in the early years of the Common Era (CE).[42]\n\nIt is noted in Sangam literature that the Chera king Uthiyan Cheralathan\nruled most of modern Kerala from his capital in Kuttanad\n,[43]\n\n[44]\n\nand controlled the port of Muziris\n, but its southern tip was in the kingdom of Pandyas\n,[45]\n\nwhich had a trading port sometimes identified in ancient Western sources as Nelcynda\n\n(or Neacyndi\n) in Quilon\n.[46]\n\nThe lesser known Ays\nand Mushikas\nkingdoms lay to the south and north of the Chera regions respectively.[47]\n\n[48]\n\n","In the last centuries BCE the coast became important to the Greeks and Romans for its spices, especially black pepper\n. The Cheras had trading links with China\n, West Asia\n, Egypt\n, Greece\n, and the Roman Empire\n.[49]\n\nIn foreign-trade circles the region was known as Male\nor Malabar\n.[50]\n\nMuziris\n, Berkarai, and Nelcynda were among the principal ports at that time.[51]\n\nThe value of Rome's annual trade with the region was estimated at around 50,000,000 sesterces\n;[52]\n\ncontemporary Sangam literature\ndescribes Roman ships coming to Muziris in Kerala, laden with gold to exchange for pepper. One of the earliest western traders to use the monsoon winds to reach Kerala was Eudoxus of Cyzicus\n, around 118 or 166\u0026#160;BCE, under the patronage of Ptolemy VIII\n, king of the Hellenistic\nPtolemaic dynasty\nin Egypt. Roman establishments in the port cities of the region, such as a temple of Augustus\n\nand barracks for garrisoned Roman soldiers, are marked in the Tabula Peutingeriana\n; the only surviving map of the Roman cursus publicus\n\n.[53]\n\n[54]\n\n","Merchants from West Asia and Southern Europe established coastal posts and settlements in Kerala.[55]\n\nThe Israeli (Jewish) connection with Kerala started in 573\u0026#160;BCE.[56]\n\n[57]\n\n[58]\n\nArabs also had trade links with Kerala, starting before the 4th century BCE, as Herodotus\n(484–413\u0026#160;BCE) noted that goods brought by Arabs from Kerala were sold to the Israelis [Hebrew (Jews)] at Eden.[51]\n\nIsraelis intermarried with local (Cheras Dravidian) people, resulting in formation of the Mappila\ncommunity.[59]\n\nIn the 4th century, some Christians also migrated from Persia\nand joined the early Syrian Christian\ncommunity who trace their origins to the evangelistic activity of Thomas the Apostle\nin the 1st century.[60]\n\n[61]\n\nMappila (Semitic)\nwas an honorific title that had been assigned to respected visitors from abroad; Israelite(Jewish), Syrian (Aramaic) Christian, and Muslim\nimmigration account for later names of the respective communities: Juda Mappilas\n, Nasrani Mappilas\n, and Muslim Mappilas\n.[62]\n\n[63]\n\nThe earliest Saint Thomas Christian Churches\n,[64]\n\nCheraman Juma Masjid\n(629 CE)—the first mosque of India[65]\n\n—and Paradesi Synagogue\n(1568 CE)—the oldest active synagogue in the Commonwealth of Nations\n[66]\n\n—were built in Kerala.[59]\n\n","A second Chera Kingdom\n(c. 800–1102), also known as Kulasekhara dynasty of Mahodayapuram\n(present-day Kodungallur\n), was established by Kulasekhara Varman\n, which ruled over a territory comprising the whole of modern Kerala and a smaller part of modern Tamil Nadu. During the early part of the Kulasekara period, the southern region from Nagerkovil\nto Thiruvalla\nwas ruled by Ay kings\n, who lost their power in the 10th century, making the region a part of the Kulasekara empire.[67]\n\n[68]\n\nUnder Kulasekhara rule, Kerala witnessed a developing period of art, literature, trade and the Bhakti movement\nof Hinduism.[69]\n\nA Keralite\nidentity, distinct from the Tamils\n, became linguistically separate during this period around the seventh century.[70]\n\nFor local administration, the empire was divided into provinces under the rule of Naduvazhis\n, with each province comprising a number of Desams\nunder the control of chieftains, called as Desavazhis\n.[69]\n\n","The inhibitions, caused by a series of Chera-Chola wars in the 11th century, resulted in the decline of foreign trade in Kerala ports. In addition, Portuguese invasions in the 15th century caused two major religion Buddhism\nand Jainism\nto disappear from the land. It is known that the Menons in the Malabar region of Kerala were originally strong believers of Jainism\n. [71]\n\nThe social system became fractured with divisions on caste\nlines.[72]\n\nFinally, the Kulasekhara dynasty was subjugated in 1102 by the combined attack of Later Pandyas\nand Later Cholas\n.[67]\n\nHowever, in the 14th century, Ravi Varma Kulashekhara (1299–1314) of the southern Venad kingdom\nwas able to establish a short-lived supremacy over southern India. After his death, in the absence of a strong central power, the state was divided into thirty small warring principalities; the most powerful of them were the kingdom of Samuthiri\nin the north, Venad in the south and Kochi in the middle. In the 18th Century, Travancore King Sree Anizham Thirunal Marthanda Varma\nannexed all the kingdoms up to Northern Kerala through military conquests, resulting in the rise of Travancore to pre-eminence in Kerala. The Kochi ruler sued for peace with Anizham Thirunal and Malabar came under direct British rule\nuntil India became independent\n.[73]\n\n[74]\n\n","The maritime spice trade\nmonopoly in the Indian Ocean\n(Indu Maha Samundr) stayed with the Arabs during the High\nand Late Middle Ages\n. However, the dominance of Middle East traders was challenged in the European Age of Discovery\n. After Vasco Da Gama\n's arrival in Kappad\nKozhikode\nin 1498, the Portuguese\nbegan to dominate eastern shipping, and the spice-trade in particular.[75]\n\n[76]\n\n[77]\n\nThe Zamorin\nof Kozhikode permitted the new visitors to trade with his subjects such that Portuguese trade in Kozhikode prospered with the establishment of a factory\nand a fort. However, Portuguese attacks on Arab properties in his jurisdiction provoked the Zamorin and led to conflicts between them. The Portuguese took advantage of the rivalry between the Zamorin and the King of Kochi allied with Kochi. When Francisco de Almeida\nwas appointed as Viceroy of Portuguese India in 1505, his headquarters was established at Fort Kochi\n(Fort Emmanuel\n) rather than in Kozhikode. During his reign, the Portuguese managed to dominate relations with Kochi and established a few fortresses on the Malabar Coast.[78]\n\nHowever, the Portuguese suffered setbacks from attacks by Zamorin forces; especially from naval attacks under the leadership Kozhikode admirals known as Kunjali Marakkars\n, which compelled them to seek a treaty.

Until 2005, it was placed with the Himalayan tahr\n(Hemitragus jemlahicus\n) and the Arabian tahr\n(Arabitragus jayakari\n) in the genus Hemitragus\n. However, it has recently been transferred to a new genus Nilgiritragus\nbecause it is genetically\nmore similar to members of the genus Ovis\n\nthan to other tahrs.[6]\n\n","The Nilgiri tahr is a stocky goat with short, coarse fur and a bristly mane. Males are larger than females and of darker color when mature. Both sexes have curved horns, reaching up to 40 centimetres (16\u0026#160;in) for males and 30 centimetres (12\u0026#160;in) for females. Adult males weigh 80 to 100 kilograms (180 to 220\u0026#160;lb) and stand about 100 centimetres (39\u0026#160;in) tall at the shoulder. Adult males develop a light grey area on their backs and are thus called \"saddlebacks\".[2]\n\n","The Nilgiri tahr inhabits the open montane grassland\nhabitat of the South Western Ghats montane rain forests\necoregion. At elevations from 1,200 to 2,600 metres (3,900 to 8,500\u0026#160;ft), the forests open into grasslands interspersed with pockets of stunted forests, locally known as sholas\n\n. These grassland habitats are surrounded by dense forests at the lower elevations. The Nilgiri tahrs formerly ranged over these grasslands in large herds, but hunting and poaching in the nineteenth century reduced their population.[1]\n\n[7]\n\n","As few as 100 Nilgiri tahrs were left in the wild by the early 20th century. Since that time their numbers have inceased somewhat; in a comprehensive study of the Nilgiri tahr population in Western Ghats, the WWF-India has put the population at 3,122.[8]\n\nTheir range extends over 400 kilometres (250\u0026#160;mi) from north to south, and Eravikulam National Park\nis home to the largest population. As per the Wildlife census conducted by Kerala forest department in association with volunteers from College of Forestry \u0026amp; Veterinary Science under Kerala Agricultural University, from April 24–28, 2014, number of animals in Eravikulam National Park has increased to 894 individuals. This is the highest ever count recorded in the national park, with the first census in 1996 finding only 640 tahrs.[7]\n\nThe other significant concentration is in the Nilgiri Hills\n, with smaller populations in the Anamalai Hills\n, Periyar National Park, Palni Hills and other pockets in the Western Ghats south of Eravikulam, almost to India's southern tip. A small populations of tahr numbering around 200 are known to inhabit the Boothapandi, Azhakiyapandipuram, Velimalai, Kulasekaram and Kaliyal Ranges in the Kanyakumari district\nof Tamil Nadu\n[9]\n\nand another small herd of less than 30 animals is known to inhibit Ponmudi hills in Trivandrum district of Kerala\n[10]\n\n","female","juvenile","in mountain grasslands","The Nilgiri Tahrs making their way down the mountain","adult male and a pallid harrier (female)","[1]\n\n"]},"downloaded":true}

???? ??????? ?????????), is a national park\nwith a core zone of 237.52 square kilometres (92\u0026#160;sq\u0026#160;mi) (making it the second largest national park in Kerala). This national park has some rare species of flora and fauna. It is located in the Nilgiri hills\n, within the palakkad District\nof Kerala\n, South India\n. This region was explored in 1847 by the botanist Robert Wight\n,[1]\n\nThis park is one of the last undisturbed tracts of South Western Ghats mountain rain forests\nand tropical moist evergreen forest\nin India\n. Contiguous with the proposed Karimpuzha National Park\n(225\u0026#160;km2\n) to the north and Mukurthi National Park\n(78.46\u0026#160;km2\n) to the north-east, it is the core of the Nilgiri International Biosphere Reserve\n(1,455.4\u0026#160;km2\n), and is part of The Nilgiri Sub-Cluster (6,000+\nkm2\n), Western Ghats\nWorld Heritage Site\n, recognised by UNESCO\nin 2007.[2]\n\n","Plans for a hydroelectric\nproject that threatened the park's rich\nwildlife\nstimulated an environmentalist\nsocial movement\nin the 1970s, known as the Save Silent Valley\nmovement, which resulted in cancellation of the project and creation of the park in 1980. The visitors' centre for the park is at Sairandhri\n.","","","The Silent Valley region is locally known as \"Sairandhrivanam\n\", which in Malayalam\nmeans Sairandhri's Forest\n. Sairandhri is Draupadi\n, the wife of the Pandavas\nin the epic Mahabharatha, who disguised herself as Sairandhri, the maid of a queen named Sudeshna, while her family was in exile.[3]\n\nThe Pandavas, deprived of their kingdom, set out on a 13-year exile. They wandered south, into what is now Kerala, until one day they came upon a magical valley where rolling grasslands met wooded ravines, a deep green river bubbled its course through impenetrable forest, where at dawn and twilight the tiger and elephant would drink together at the water's edge, where all was harmonious and man unknown. Beside that river, in a cave on a hill slope, the Pandavas halted.[4]\n\n","The first Western investigation of the watersheds\nof the Silent Valley area was in 1857 by the botanist Robert Wight\n.[1]\n\nThe British named the area Silent Valley because of a perceived absence of noisy cicadas\n. Another story attributes the name to the anglicisation of Sairandhri. A third story, refers to the presence there of many lion-tailed macaques Macaca silenus\n\n.[5]\n\nIn 1914 the forest of the Silent Valley area was declared a reserve forest\n, however, from 1927 to 1976 portions of the Silent Valley forest area were subjected to forestry\noperations. In 1928 the location on the Kunthipuzha\nRiver at Sairandhri was identified as an ideal site for electricity generation\nand in 1958 a study and survey of the area was conducted and a hydroelectric project of 120 MV costing Rs. 17 crore was proposed by the Kerala State Electricity Board\n.[6]\n\n","Silent Valley is home to the largest population of lion-tailed macaques\n, an endangered species\nof primate\n. Public controversy over their habitat led to the establishment of Silent Valley National Park.","In 1973 the valley became the focus of \"Save Silent Valley\", India's fiercest environmental\nmovement of the decade, when the Kerala State Electricity Board decided to implement the Silent Valley Hydro-Electric Project (SVHEP) centered on a dam\nacross the Kunthipuzha River\n. The resulting reservoir would flood 8.3\u0026#160;km2\nof virgin rainforest\nand threaten the lion-tailed macaque. In 1976 the Kerala State Electricity Board announced plans to begin dam construction and the issue was brought to public attention. Romulus Whitaker\n, founder of the Madras Snake Park and the Madras Crocodile Bank\n, was probably the first person to draw public attention to the small and remote area.[7]\n\n","In 1983 the then Prime Minister of India\n, Indira Gandhi\n, decided to abandon the Project and on November 15 the Silent Valley forests were declared as a National Park. On September 7, 1985 the Silent Valley National Park was formally inaugurated and a memorial at Sairandhri to Indira Gandhi was unveiled by Sri. Rajiv Gandhi\n, her son and the next Prime Minister. On September 1, 1986 Silent Valley National Park was designated as the core area of the Nilgiri Biosphere Reserve\n. Since then, a long-term conservation effort has been undertaken to preserve the Silent Valley ecosystem\n.[6]\n\n","In 2001 a new hydro project was proposed and the \"Man vs. Monkey debate\" was revived. The proposed site of the dam (64.5 m high and 275 m long) is just 3.5\u0026#160;km downstream of the old dam site at Sairandhiri, 500 m outside the National Park boundary.[8]\n\nThe Kerala Minister for Electricity called The Pathrakkadavu dam (PHEP) an \"eco-friendly alternative\" to the old Silent Valley project. The claim was that the submergence area of the PHEP would be a negligible .041\u0026#160;km2\ncompared to 8.30\u0026#160;km2\nsubmergence of the 1970s (SVHEP).[9]\n\nFrom January to May 2003, a rapid Environmental Impact Assessment\n(EIA) was carried out. On November 15, Minister for Forest Binoy Viswam said that the proposed buffer zone\nfor Silent Valley would be declared soon.[10]\n\n","On February 21, 2007 ex-Chief Minister A. K. Antony told reporters after a cabinet meeting that \"when the Silent Valley proposal was dropped, the centre had promised to give clearance to the Pooyamkutty project. This promise, however, had not been honoured. The Kerala government has not taken any decision\non reviving the Silent Valley Hydel Project\".[11]\n\n","On April 18, 2007, Kerala Chief Minister V S Achuthanandan and his cabinet approved the Pathrakkadavu Hydro-electric project and sent it to the Union Government\nfor environmental approval.[12]\n\n[13]\n\n","Territorial forests located around the national park have been subject to a working-plan to accomplish revenue oriented objectives such as extraction of bamboo and reed which affect the long-term conservation of the park. In addition Illegal activities such as ganja cultivation, setting forest fires, trapping and poaching wild animals, frequently occur in the territorial forests located in the immediate vicinity of the national park. This has resulted in degradation of habitat and reduced forest cover, which has adverse effects on the long-term survival of the core area of the national park.[14]\n\n","Silent Valley National Park Bridge","On November 21, 2009, Union Minister of Forest and Environment Jairam Ramesh\nand Kerala Forest Minister Binoy Viswam declared, while inaugurating the silver jubilee celebration of Silent Valley National Park in Palakkad, that the buffer zone of the Park would be made an integral part of it in order to ensure better protection of the area.[15]\n\nThis means that the total park area is now increased to 236.74 square kilometres (91\u0026#160;sq\u0026#160;mi). It is now the largest national park in Kerala.[1]\n","On June 6, 2007 the Kerala cabinet approved the buffer zone proposal. The new 147.22\u0026#160;km2\nzone will include 80.75\u0026#160;km2\ntaken from Attapady Forest Range, 27.09\u0026#160;km2\nfrom Mannarkkad Forest Range and 39.38\u0026#160;km2\nfrom Kalikavu Forest Range and consolidated to form a new range, Bhavani Forest Range, of 94\u0026#160;km2\nand 54\u0026#160;km2\nwould be brought under the existing Silent Valley Range of the National Park. The Cabinet also sanctioned 35 staff to protect the area and two new forest stations in Bhavani range at Anavai and Thudukki. Forest Minister Benoy Viswom said \"the zone would have reserve forest status and tribals in the area would not be affected. The decision reaffirmed the commitment of the LDF\nGovernment to protection of environment. The zone is a necessity, not just of the State but also of the nation.\"[16]\n\n","The proposal was then sent to Kerala Minister for Electricity, Mr. A.K. Balan, who has voiced the need for setting up the Pathrakadavu hydroelectric project in the proposed southwest buffer zone of the National Park, the Thenkara Range of the Mannarkkad Forest Division. As of May 9, 2007 Mr. Balan has not given his opinion on the buffer zone proposal.[17]\n\n","In August 2006, the new Minister for Forests, Benoy Viswom, approved a proposal from the Conservator of Forests for a 148\u0026#160;km2\nbuffer zone around the core area of the park. The proposal says: \"It is felt absolutely essential that an effective buffer of forests should be immediately formed around the national park in order to save the world famous Silent Valley National Park from all potential dangers. This can only be achieved by bringing the management of Silent Valley National Park as well as the proposed buffer zone under one management umbrella to insulate the park from all possible dangers.\" The proposed buffer zone will have 94\u0026#160;km2\nin Attappady Reserve Forest east of the Kunthipuzha and 54\u0026#160;km2\ntaken from the Mannarkaad range and Nilambur south division west of the river.","In January 2006, the former Kerala Minister for Forest and Environment, A. Sujanapal, said the Government would consider the demand for a 600\u0026#160;km2\nbuffer zone for Silent Valley National Park made by Bharathapuzha Protection Committee, Malampuzha Protection Committee, One Earth One Life and Jana Jagratha. A buffer zone proposal was made in the 1986 park management plan but not implemented.[18]\n\n","In 1979, Dr. M.S. Swaminathan\n, then Secretary to the Department of Agriculture, visited the Silent Valley area and suggested that 389.52\u0026#160;km2\nincluding the Silent Valley (89.52\u0026#160;km2\n), New Amarambalam\n(80\u0026#160;km2\n), Attappadi\n(120\u0026#160;km2\n) in Kerala and Kunda in Coimbatore\n(100\u0026#160;km2\n) reserve forests\n, should be developed into a National Rainforest Biosphere Reserve\n.[19]\n\n","Silent Valley is rectangular, twelve kilometres from north to south and seven from east to west. Located between 11°03' to 11°13' N (latitude) and 76°21' to 76°35' E (longitude) it is separated from the eastern and northern high altitude plateaus\nof the (Nilgiris Mountains\n) by high continuous ridges including Sispara Peak\n(2,206 m) at the north end of the park. The park gradually slopes southward down to the Palakkad\nplains and to the west it is bounded by irregular ridges. The altitude varies from 658 m to 2328 m at Anginda Peak\n, but most of the park lies within the altitude range of 880 m to 1200 m. Soils are blackish and slightly acidic in evergreen forests where there is good accumulation of organic matter. The underlying rock in the area is granite\nwith schists\nand gneiss\n, which give rise to the loamy laterite\nsoils on slopes.[20]\n\n","The Kuntipuzha River drains\nthe entire 15\u0026#160;km length of the park from north to south into the Bharathapuzha\nRiver. Kuntipuzha River divides the park into a narrow eastern sector of width 2 kilometers and a wide western sector of 5 kilometers. The river is characterized by its crystal clear water and perennial nature. The main tributaries\nof the river, Kunthancholapuzha, Karingathodu, Madrimaranthodu, Valiaparathodu and Kummaathanthodu originate on the upper slopes of the eastern side of the valley. The river is uniformly shallow, with no flood plains or meanders. Its bed falls from 1,861 m to 900 m over a distance of 12\u0026#160;km, the last 8\u0026#160;km being particularly level with a fall of only 60 m. Kuntipuzha is one of the less torrential rivers of the Western Ghats, with a pesticide-free catchment area.[21]\n\n","Silent Valley gets copious amounts of rainfall\nduring the monsoons\n, but the actual amount varies within the region due to the varied topography. In general, rainfall is higher at higher altitudes and decreases from the west to the east due to the rain shadow\neffect. Eighty per cent of the rainfall occurs during the south-west monsoon between June and September. The park also receives a significant amount of rainfall during the north-east monsoon between October and November.[22]\n\n","The park being completely enclosed within a ring of hills, has its own micro-climate\nand probably receives some convectional rainfall\n, in addition to rain from the two monsoons. In the remaining months, condensation\non vegetation of mist\nshrouding the valley is estimated to yield 15 per cent of the total water generated in the rainforest.[23]\n\n","In 2006, the Walakkad area of the park received the highest ever annual rainfall of 9,569.6\u0026#160;mm.

Falls\n, is situated in Athirappilly\nPanchayat, Chalakudy\nTaluk, Thrissur District\nof Kerala\n, India\non the Chalakudy River\n, which originates from the upper reaches of the Western Ghats\nat the entrance to the Sholayar ranges.It is the largest waterfall in Kerala, which stands tall at 80 feet. Just a short drive from Athirapally to the Vazhachal falls\n, which is close to dense green forests that are home to many endangered and endemic species of flora and fauna.","There is another waterfall on the way from Athirappilly to Vazhachal Falls\n, in close proximity to the road, which is locally called \"Charpa Falls\n\". Athirappilly Falls is the largest waterfall in Kerala and is nicknamed \"The Niagara\nof India\".[1]\n\n","Controversy about a state-proposed hydroelectric dam on the Chalakudy River above the waterfalls began in the 1990s and continued through 2017.","","","The 145 kilometres (90\u0026#160;mi) long Chalakudy River, originates in the Anamudi\nmountains of the Western Ghats\n[2]\n\nand flows through the Vazhachal Forest toward the Arabian Sea. The river initially runs smoothly but becomes more turbulent as it nears Athirapilly. At Athirappilly Falls, the water surges around big rocks and cascades down in three separate plumes. Below the falls, the river remains turbulent for about 1 kilometre (0.62\u0026#160;mi) until it reaches Kannamkuzhi. Then it calms and flows smoothly until reaching the dam at Thumburmuzhi.","Forest wildlife in the area includes the Asiatic elephant\n, tiger\n, leopard\n, bison\n, sambar\n, and lion-tailed macaque\n. The unique 180 metres (590\u0026#160;ft) elevation riparian forest in the Athirappilly-Vazhachal area is the only location where all four South Indian species of hornbills — the great hornbill\n(the state bird of Kerala), Malabar pied hornbill\n, Malabar grey hornbill\n, and the Indian grey hornbill\nare found living together. If the proposed 163-MW Athirappilly hydroelectric project is built, these unique birds may vanish from these forests because it will submerge the hornbills' habitat.[3]\n\n","Plantations in the area contain teak\n, bamboo\n, and eucalyptus\n. Environmentalists claim that Athirappilly is a one-of its-kind riparian ecosystem in Kerala. V.S. Vijayan, Chairman of the Kerala State Biodiversity Board and former Director of the Salim Ali Centre for Ornithology and Natural History (SACON), Coimbatore, has been quoted in Down to Earth magazine as affirming that the Vazhachal forest division is the second most biodiverse area in the State. The International Bird Association has declared it an ‘Important Bird Area' and the Asian Nature Conservation Foundation has recommended that the area should be declared a sanctuary or a national park, he points out. The Wildlife Trust of India says it represents one of India's best elephant conservation efforts. “Any disruption to this fragile ecosystem will spell disaster,” says Vijayan. [4]\n\nThe river provides habitat for 85 species of fresh water fishes. Among these, 35 are endemic species.","The railway station nearest Athirappilly Falls is 30\u0026#160;kilometres\u0026#160;(19\u0026#160;mi)\nto the west in Chalakudi Railway Station\n, and the nearest airport is Kochi International Airport\n, about 55\u0026#160;kilometres\u0026#160;(34\u0026#160;mi)\nsouthwest of the waterfall and 58\u0026#160;kilometres\u0026#160;(36\u0026#160;mi)\nsouth of City of Thrissur\n.[5]\n\nAthirappilly is easily reachable from Chalakudy\nby taxi or by bus from the Chalakudy\nprivate bus terminal. Athirappilly is situated on the highways connecting Tamil Nadu\nand Kerala\n, amidst thick forest, so night riding is not advised.","The journey from Chalakudy\nto the Athirappilly Falls passes through a landscape of winding roads, small villages and lush green trees. Visitors can reach the top of the waterfall via a paved path that leads through thick bamboo clusters. A steep narrow path also leads to the bottom of the falls. The falls attract visitors from across India, especially during the monsoon\nmonths (June–September). About 7 million tourists visit the falls and the Vazhachal picnic spot each year.[6]\n\n","Daily jungle safari trips are organized by Thrissur District Tourism Promotion Council with Athirappilly Destination Management Counci from Chalakudy\nto Malakkappara.","The scenic beauty of Athirappilly falls has always been attractive to filmmakers. It has been used as a location for several Malayalam films\n.","Some of the major films with scenes around the falls are:","In 1994, the Kerala State Electricity Board (KSEB) proposed a 163 megawatt Athirappilly Hydro Electric Project. It was to include a dam 23\u0026#160;metres\u0026#160;(75\u0026#160;ft)\nhigh and 311\u0026#160;metres\u0026#160;(1,020\u0026#160;ft)\nwide on the Chalakudy River in the Vazhachal Forest Division about 5\u0026#160;kilometres\u0026#160;(3\u0026#160;mi)\nupstream of Athirappilly Falls and 400\u0026#160;metres\u0026#160;(1,312\u0026#160;ft)\nupstream of Vazhachal Rapids (Vazhachal Falls).[7]\n\nHowever, environmental groups and people's collectives opposed the project on grounds that it would damage the environment, infringe on human rights, and threaten tourism.[8]\n\nThough it was not their main concern, critics also noted that if the entire course of the river were diverted to make electricity, the Athirappilly-Vazhachal waterfalls could dry up. To avoid damaging the falls, the KSEB proposed adjusting the water releases to maintain the falls.[9]\n\nThe debate continued in 2007. Environmentalists also expressed concern over whether the proposed hydroelectric project at Athirappilly waterfalls would lead to displacement and eventual extinction of the primitive tribal group, 'Kadars,' in the area. [10]\n\n","In 2005, the Kerala Ministry of Environment and Forests approved the project on the basis of a report by Water and Power Consultancy Services (India) Ltd. (WAPCOS), an environmental impact assessment\n(EIA) agency. In 2006, the Kerala High Court\nquashed the clearance and ordered another public hearing.[11]\n\n[12]\n\nThe debate continued the following years.","On 29th Jan 2011, the chairman of the Western Ghats Ecology Expert Panel (WGEEP) Madhav Gadgil\nopined that the Environment Impact Assessment (EIA) of the Athirappilly hydel power project was not properly carried out and 70% of it is bogus. The panel, appointed by the Union Ministry of Environment and Forests, was asked to look into and give recommendations on various projects in the Western Ghats such as the hydroelectric projects in Gundiya in Karnataka and Athirappilly in Kerala and the overall development projects in Ratnagiri and Sindhudurg districts of Maharashtra. Gadgil said that the proposed Athirappilly hydro-electric project cannot be approved until the Forest Rights Act is implemented in its true spirit for the Kadar tribal community of the area and also no comprehensive study had been carried out so far on the natural riparian forest vegetation along the Western Ghats.[13]\n\n[14]\n\n[15]\n\nOn 14th Jun 2011, Union Minister for Environment and Forests Jairam Ramesh\nsaid his ministry would not grant approval to the Athirappilly hydro electric project.[16]\n\nThe minister also stated “When states are denied such projects on larger and long-term environmental considerations, they are entitled to some sort of green bonus,”[17]\n\nThe first part of WGEEP report was submitted to the Ministry on August 31.The Western Ghats Ecology Expert Panel (WGEEP), on Sep 6th 2011 recommended to the Union Ministry of Environment and Forests against granting permission to carry out any construction activities at the sensitive Athirappilly-Vazhachal region. The panel, which submitted its report to Union Environment Minister Jayanti Natarajan in the capital, named Athirappilly as one of the 18 eco-sensitive localities (ESL) in the state.[18]\n\nBut K. Radhakrishnan, a former member (generation), KSEB, has opined that this panel report was highly biased with vested interests and the project was eco-friendly doing minimum damage to environment and forests.[19]\n\n[20]\n\n[21]\n\nWhile there are reports from renowned experts from Kerala State Biodiversity Board that the power project would adversely affect the ecology of the area and the estimated power output would be dependable upon the rainfall and dry summer seasons, which is undependable in its own way. M. Sivasankar, a KSEB chairman and MD states the need of more environment-friendly power projects with lower operating cost and higher output like super critical boiler\nplants. Cheemeni Power Project which is planned to produce 1500 MW is such a project in the government binders.[22]\n\n"]},"downloaded":true}

Wildlife Sanctuary\n(Malayalam\n: ?????? ???????? ???????\n) is an animal sanctuary\nin Wayanad\n, Kerala\n, India\n. It has an extent of 344.44\u0026#160;km2\nwith four ranges namely Sulthan Bathery, Muthanga, Kurichiat and Tholpetty. A variety of large wild animals such as Indian bison\n, elephant\n, deer\nand tiger\nare found there. There are also quite a few unusual birds in the sanctuary. In particular, peafowl\ntend to be very common in the area. Wayanad Wildlife Sanctuary is the second largest wildlife sanctuary in Kerala. It is bestowed with lush green forests and rich wildlife.This wildlife area houses some of the rare and endangered species\nof both flora and fauna.","Established in 1973, the sanctuary is now an integral part of the Nilgiri Biosphere Reserve\n. It is bounded by protected area network of Nagarhole\nand Bandipur\nof Karnataka\nin the northeast, and on the southeast by Mudumalai\nof Tamil Nadu\n.","It is part of the Wayanad Plateau\nand the vegetation is predominantly of the south Indian moist deciduous teak forests. Also, the sanctuary has pastures of the west-coast semi-evergreen trees. The wildlife sanctuary comes under Protect Elephant and one can spot herd of elephants roaming in the area. Elephant rides are arranged by the Kerala Forest Department\n.","Wayanad district has the largest population of Adivasi\nin Kerala. Scheduled tribes here include Paniyas\n, Kurumas\n, Adiyars\n, Kurichyas\n, Ooralis\nand Kattunaikkans\n. Comprising an area of 2126\u0026#160;km2\n, Wayanad has a powerful history. Relicts and edicts found in various parts of Wayanad speak of an important prehistoric era. Historians are of the view that organised human life existed in these parts, at least ten centuries before Christ.","The sanctuary is part of the Nilgiri Biosphere Reserve. The Western Ghats\n, Nilgiri Sub-Cluster\n(6,000+\nkm²), including all of the sanctuary, is under consideration by the World Heritage Committee\nfor selection as a World Heritage Site\n.[2]\n\n","","","Wayanad Wildlife Sanctuary was formed in 1973 and was brought under the Project Elephant in 1991–92. This sanctuary occupies an area of 345\u0026#160;km2\n. It is the second largest one in the state of Kerala\n. The sanctuary is separated into two disconnected parts known as the North Wayanad Wildlife Sanctuary and South Wayanad Wildlife Sanctuary. The area in between the two parts was originally a forest region, though it is now occupied majorly by plantations.","In 2012, a tiger was shot dead by the Kerala Forest Department on a coffee plantation on the fringes of the Wayanad Wildlife Sanctuary. Many local political leaders applauded the killing of the tiger. Chief Wildlife Warden of Kerala ordered the hunt for the animal after mass protests erupted as the tiger had been carrying away domestic animals.","Flora:\nMoist deciduous forest consists of maruthi, karimaruthi, rosewood, venteak, vengal, chadachi, mazhukanjiram, bamboos, more, while the semi-evergreen patches comprises veteria indica., lagerstroemia, lanceolata, termianalia paniculata.","Fauna:\nElephants, tigers, panthers, jungle cats, civet cats, monkeys, wild dogs, bisons, deer, bears, monitor lizards and a variety of snakes are seen.","Avian-Fauna:\nPeacocks, babblers, cuckoos, owls, woodpeckers, jungle fowls are a few of the various types of birds seen here.","Wayanad climate is salubrious. Average rain fall in this district is 2322 m.m. Annual rain fall in these high rain fall areas ranges from 3,000 to 4,000\u0026#160;mm. High velocity winds are common during the south west monsoon and dry winds blow in March–April. High altitude regions experience severe cold. This place experiences a high relative humidity which goes even up to 95 per cent during the south west monsoon period. Generally, the year is classified into four seasons, namely, cold weather, hot weather, south west monsoon and north east monsoon. The dale, 'Lakkidi', nestled among the hills of Vythiri taluk has the highest average rainfall in Kerala.","Location:\nThe south Wayanad division is located 16\u0026#160;km east of Sulthan Bathery and north wayanad division 20\u0026#160;km from Mananthavady in the state of Kerala\n.","Wayanad Wildlife Sanctuary is one of the safest havens for different species of vultures like the White-rumped Vultures\nand the Red-headed Vultures\n. The collective population of these vultures numbered around 150 in February 2016 dropped to about 70 in March 2016. A survey last year counted as many as 17 vulture nests, however, this number reduced to about 11 vulture nests in March 2016. The banned drug Diclofenac\nis believed to be the reason for this fall in the vulture count.[3]\n\n","Reference Link\u0026#160;: https://www.gotirupati.com/wayanad-wildlife-sanctuary\n"]},"downloaded":true}

The region has the lowest altitude in India, and is one of the few places in the world where farming is carried around 1.2 to 3.0 metres (4 to 10\u0026#160;ft) below sea level. Kuttanadu is historically important in the ancient history of South India and is the major rice producer in the state. Farmers of Kuttinad are famous for Biosaline Farming. FAO has declared the Kuttanad Farming System as a Globally Important Agricultural Heritage Systems (GIAHS). Four of Kerala's major rivers, the Pamba\n, Meenachil\n, Achankovil\nand Manimala\nflow into the region. It is well known for it boat race in the Punnamada Backwaters. Also known in Malayalam as:(Vallamkalli).","","","The first recorded history on the origin of this land is obtained from Sangam period\nliterature. Additionally the oral history among local people, transferred from generation to generation is a blend of myths and legends is a valuable resource. According to Sangam era documents, Uthiyan Cheralatan\n(Perum Chorru Udiyan Cheralathan\n, Athan I\n), or Udiyanjeral (AD first century.\n) is the first recorded Chera dynasty\nruler of the Sangam period\nin ancient South India\n.[1]\n\n[2]\n\nHe had his capital at a place called Kuzhumur in Kuttanad (central Kerala\n) and expanded the kingdom northward and eastward from his original homeland. His lifetime is broadly determined to be between first century BC and 2nd century AD.His queen was Veliyan Nallini, the daughter of Veliyan Venman. Uthiyan Cheralathan\nwas a contemporary of the Chola ruler Karikala Chola\n. He is praised for his elephant corps and cavalry. Present day Changanacherry end of Kuttanad was the capital of the Chera\ndynasty king Uthiyan_Cheralathan\n.His descendant was Senguttavan\n(Chenguttavan means \"brave-hearted\" in malayalam\nand his name is carried by the next towns of Chenganacherri\nand Chengana\nto the present day). According to sangam literature, Cheralathan\nwas defeated in the Battle of Venni\nwith Karikala Chola\nand the capital was burnt down . Another local legend says Kuttanad was believed to be forest with dense tree growth. This forest was destroyed subsequently by a wild fire.","It is a well known fact that burned black wooden logs were mined from paddy fields called as ‘Karinilam’(Black paddy fields) until the recent past. This fact throws some light on this theory of Chuttanad evolving to Kuttanad. In Kuttanad most of the place names end in kari (meaning burnt residue or charcoal). Some familiar place names are Ramankary, Puthukkary, Amichakary, Oorukkary, Mithrakary, Mampuzhakary, Kainakary\n, Kandanakary\n, Thayamkary, Chathurthiakary and Chennamkary\n.","The Kuttanad region is categorised into:","Lower Kuttanadu comprises taluks of Ambalapuzha\ntaluk, Kuttanadu (excluding Edathua\n, Thalavady\nand Muttar\n, and the northern half of Karthikapally\ntaluk in Alappuzha district\n).","Upper Kuttanad comprises Veeyapuram\nand Pallippad\nin Karthikapally\ntaluk, Edathua\n, Thalavady\n, Kidangara\nand Muttar\nin Kuttanad taluk\n; Chennithala\nvillage in Mavelikkara\n, Mannar\n, Kuruttissery\n, Budhanur\n, Ennakkad\nvillages in Chengannur taluk\nof Alappuzha district\n; and Parumala\n, Kadapra\n, Niranam\n, Pulikeezhu\n, Peringara\n, Chathenkeri\n, Nedumpuram\n, villages of Thiruvalla\nin Pathanamthitta district\n.","North Kuttanad comprises Vaikom\ntaluk, western parts of Kottayam\ntaluk, and western parts of Changanacherry\ntaluk in Kottayam district\n.","A few of the major villages which form Kuttanad are: Kainakary\n, Ramankary\n, Puthukkary, Chennamkary\n, Nedumudi\n, Niranam\n, Kaipuzha\n, Kumarakom\n, Edathua\n, Mampuzhakkary\n, Neelamperoor\n, Kainady\n, Kavalam\n, Pulincunnoo\n, Manalady\n, Kannady\nKayalpuram, Veliyanadu\n, Veeyapuram, Vezhapra, Kunnamkary\n, Kumaramkary\n, Valady\n, Kidangara\n, Mithrakary\n, Muttar\n, Neerattupuram\n, Thalavadi\n, Changankary\n, Champakulam\n, Nedumudi\n, Moonnatummukham\n, Melpadom\n, Pulincunnu\n, Pallippad\n","Payippad\n, Karichal\n, Ayaparambu\n, Anary\n, Vellamkulangara\n, Pilappuzha\n, Pandi\n, Edathua\n, Pacha\n, Chekkidikad\n, Thakazhy\n, Cheruthana\n, Karuvatta\n, Chennithala\n, Narakathara\n, Venattukad\n, Kayalppuram\n, Mankompu\n, Chathurthiakary\n, Koduppunna\n, Oorukkary\n, Thayankary\n, Thiruvarpu\n, Pullangadi\nand payattupakka\n, Kandankary\namong others.","The major occupation in Kuttanadu is farming, with rice the most important agricultural product. This activity gives the area its moniker of \"The Rice Bowl of Kerala\". Three crops are grown every year now instead of the traditional practice of two crops per year. Large farming areas near Vembanad Lake\nwere reclaimed from the lake. The history of paddy cultivation in Kuttanad can be traced back centuries. The evolution of paddy cultivation correlated with technological advancement and changes in the regulatory framework that existed during the 19th and 20th centuries. In earlier times, reclamation was carried out mainly from the shallow part of the Vembanad Lake or from the periphery of the Pamba River\n. These reclamations constituted small areas of paddy fields called padsekharams\n. Bailing out of water from the fields were done manually using water wheels called chakram\n. Gradually the manual method used for bailing out of water gave way to steam engines.","There were robberies in Kuttanad in earlier days, which were prohibited by the Travancore Maharajah Moolam Thirunal\n.","Three distinct stages can be identified in the reclamation of kayal lands from the lake. The first stage was carried out by private entrepreneurs without any financial support from the government. The Pattom Proclamation made by the Travencore Kingdom in 1865, gave a great fillip to reclamation activities between 1865 and 1888. During this period de-watering of the polders was done manually using chakram\n, which restricted large-scale reclamation. Only about 250 hectares of land were reclaimed during this period. Venadu kayal and Madathil Kayal were reclaimed during this period and are considered the first \"Kayal Nilams\" to be reclaimed from the Vembanad Lake.[3]\n\nThese pioneering reclamation activities in kayal cultivation were made by the two brothers Mathai Luka Pallithanam and Ouseph Luka Pallithanam from Kainady village in Kuttanadu.[4]\n\n","The second phase started during 1888. One of the reclamation during this period was undertaken by Chalayil Eravi Kesava Panicker. He chose to reclaim Vembanad kayal from the mouth of the Chennamkari river as it joins with the back waters. The reclaimed kayal was known as ‘ Attumuttu Kayal’. Other major reclamation on the same year was Seminary Kayal which was undertaken by Kottayam Orthodox Seminary.","The introduction of kerosene engines for dewatering resulted in the reclamation of wider areas of the lake for cultivation. This made farmers consider venturing into the deeper parts of the lake. During the period between 1898 and 1903, reclamation activity was led by Pallithanam Luka Mathai\n(alias Pallithanathu Mathaichen) who reclaimed the Cherukara Kayal\nand Pallithanam Moovayiram Kayal. But the second phase (1890 to 1903) of reclamation activities came to a halt because of the ban on kayal reclamation imposed by the Madras Government in 1903. Cherukali Kayal, Rajapuram Kayal, Aarupanku Kayal, Pantharndu Panku kayal and Mathi Kayal were the other major reclamations during this period.","In 1912, the Madras Government approved a proposal from the Travancore Government for further reclamations in three stages. Under this scheme kayal land was notified for reclamation in blocks each named with a letter of the English alphabet. Out of the total area of 19,500 acres of kayal land, 12,000 acres were reclaimed between 1913 and 1920. After the removal of the ban in 1913, Pallithanam Luca Matthai\nalong with some other prominent families in Kuttanadu, reclaimed E-Block Kayal measuring a total area 2,400 acres. This is the biggest kayal nilam in Kuttanadu. C.J. Kurian, Ex MLC and Mr. John Illikalam were his main partners in this venture. The reclamations between 1914 and 1920, known as the new reclamations, were carried out in three periods. In the first period Blocks A to G measuring an 6300 Acres were reclaimed. C Block, D Block(Attumukham Aarayiram (Attumuttu Kayal), Thekke Aarayiram and Vadakke Aarayiram) and E Block (Erupathinalayiram Kayal) F Block (Judge's Aarayiram Kayal) and G Block (Kochu Kayal) are the major Kayal nilams reclaimed during this period.","During the second period of new reclamation, blocks H to N covering an area of 3600 acres were reclaimed under the leadership of Pallithanam Luca Matthai\n, Cunnumpurathu Kurien, Vachaparampil Mathen, Pazhayaparmpil Chacko, Kunnathusseril Peious, Ettuparayil Xavier and Pattassery PP Mathai. During the third period of new reclamation, R Block Kayal covering 1,400 acres was reclaimed by the joint efforts of eight families led by then member of Sree Moolam Popular Assembly, Pallithanam Luca Matthai\n. His partners in the reclamation included Vachaparampil Mathen, Pazhayaparmpil Chacko, Ettuparayil Xavier, Pattassery PP Mathai, Meledom, Paruthickal and Kandakudy.","From 1920 to 1940 reclamation activity came to a halt because of a steep drop in the price of rice.","Pallithanam Luca Matthai\n, who had served as member of Maharajah Moolam Thirunal's Praja Sabha\n(Popular Assembly) was considered as the pioneer of cooperative agricultural movement in Kuttanadu. His life marked the beginning of the epoch of first generation Kayal Raja\n's of Kuttanad (Kayal Raja is the term generally used to refer to the prominent kayal cultivators in the Kuttanadu region). In 1931, in order to strengthen the farming community in Kuttanadu, he founded Kuttandu Karshaka Sangham\n(Kuttanadu Agricultural Association\n). From the beginning of his farming career in his teens (he was eighteen when he reclaimed the cherukara kayal), he brought together like minded people and successfully led the reclamation activity from 1898 to 1940.","Due to the steep decline in the price of rice between 1920 and 1940 reclamation activities slowed down, but they gained momentum again in the early 1940s. During this period, in order to increase agricultural output, a government initiated \"Grow More Food\" campaiagn and the provision of incentives encouraged new reclamations. The advent of electric motors made reclamation relatively easier, cheaper and less risky as compared to in earlier periods. The last tract of the reclamations namely Q, S and T block were made during this period by Thomman Joseph Murickummoottil (Muricken Outhachan).","The prominent families in Kuttanadu who were involved in the backwater paddy cultivation are Pallithanam, Pallivathukal, Vallickadu, Pattassery, Nilavumthara - Thattacherry, Vachaparambil, Pazhayaparmbil, Thottukadavil, Chalayil, Chirayil, Vettathu, Cunnumpurathu, Illikalam, Akkara, Nilavumthara - Moolecherry, Ettuparayil, Mangalapallil, Paruthickal, Meledom, Murukkummootil, Kunnathusseril, Ottaveetil, Kottarathil etc.","As farming in the area increased, farmers felt themselves constrained by the two cycles a year for rice cultivation. The reason for which is the limited availability of potable water in Kuttanadu. During the monsoon seasons, the water from the mountains flow through the rivers to the sea, bringing potable water to Kuttanadu. But during summer, due to the low level of the region seawater enters Kuttanadu, significantly increasing the salinity of the water and making it unpotable.","Also Kuttanad is recognised as a Globally Important Agricultural Heritage Systems (GIAHS) by FAO\n","This project was designed as a permanent solution to the flood situation in Kuttanad. This programme was envisaged in such a way that flood waters from Pamba, Manimalayar and Achankovil were diverted to the sea before it reached Vembanad lake. The construction of the Spillway ended by 1959.","In 1968, the Government of India proposed that a bund (Dam\n) be made across the river so that seawater would not be allowed to come inside Kuttanad during summer, allowing farmers to cultivate an extra crop per year. The project was planned in three phases, the south side, the north side and another phase to join the two sections. The project was delayed and by the time the first two phases were complete the entire money allotted for the project ran out and left the final phase in limbo. The farmers who were expecting lots of financial benefits after the completion of the project decided to take matters into their own hands and one night in 1972, a large group of farmers filled the gap between the north and the south side with earth. To this day, the earth embankment between the two sections of the bund remains. With this, it was possible to close the regulator of shutters during December–June when the saline water enters, and then open it during monsoon. Once the Thanneermukkam bund and spillway became operational two crops were possible in Kuttanad.that are chambavu and karutha charu.","Even though the bund has improved the quality of life of the farmers, the bund is alleged to have caused severe environmental problems. The backwaters which were abundant with fish and part of the staple food of the people of the region require a small amount of salt water for its breeding. The bund has caused deterioration of fish varieties in the region and the fishermen opposed to the bund as of 2005. The bund has also disrupted the harmony of the sea with the backwaters and has caused problems not foreseen before the bund like the omniprescence of the water weeds. Earlier the salt water tends to cleanse the backwaters but this does not happen any more leading to the pollution of the backwaters and the entire land near by.","Kuttanad assembly constituency was a part of Alappuzha\n. After the Lok Sabha\ndelimitation in 2008, it now belongs to the Mavelikkara\nconstituency.[5]\n\n"]},"downloaded":true}

a beach\ntown by the Arabian Sea\nin Thiruvananthapuram\n, Kerala\n, India\n, located around 18\u0026#160;km south of the city center.[1]\n\n","","","Kovalam means a grove of coconut trees and true to its name the village offers an endless sight of coconut trees.","Kovalam first received attention when the Regent Maharani Sethu Lakshmi Bayi\nof Travancore\nconstructed her beach resort, Halcyon Castle\n, here towards the end of the 1920s. Thereafter the place was brought to the public eye by her nephew the Maharaja of Travancore\n.[2]\n\nThe European guests of the then Travancore kingdom discovered the potentiality of Kovalam beach as a tourist destination in the 1930s. However, Kovalam shot into limelight in the early seventies with arrivals of the masses of hippies\non their way to Ceylon\nin the Hippie Trail\n. This exodus started the transformation of a casual fishing village of Kerala into one of the most important tourist destinations in all India.[3]\n\n","Kovalam has three beaches separated by rocky outcroppings in its 17\u0026#160;km coastline, the three together form the famous crescent of the Kovalam beach.[4]\n\n","Detour past Kovalam junction to land on Samudra Beach which is to the north of Ashoka Beach. One has the option to walk along the sea-wall too.The sight of the waves lashing on the rocks below is awesome.","Shallow waters stretching for hundreds of metres are ideal for swimming. The beaches have steep palm covered headlands and are lined with shops that offer all kinds of goods and services.[7]\n\n","The larger of the beaches is called Lighthouse Beach for its 35 metre high light house which towers over it atop Kurumkal hillock. The second largest one is Hawah Beach named thus for the topless European women who used to throng there. It was the first topless beach in India.[citation needed\n\n\n]\nHowever topless bathing is banned now except in private coves owned by resorts. Visitors frequent these two beaches. The northern part of the beach is known as Samudra Beach in tourism parlance. A large promontory separates this part from the southern side. Samudra Beach doesn't have tourists thronging there or hectic business. The local fishermen ply their trade on this part. The sands on the beaches in Kovalam are partially black in colour due to the presence of ilmenite\nand Monazite\n. The normal tourist season is from September to May. Ashoka beach is also the part of Kovalam beach.","There are a large number of beach resorts in and around Kovalam. The sea port of Vizhinjam\nis about 3\u0026#160;km away and famous for its special varieties of fish, old Hindu temples, big churches and a mosque.

a tourist town in the Trivandrum\ndistrict of Kerala\nstate, South India\n. This village is almost at the southern tip of Trivandrum\nwhile the next village, Pozhiyoor\n, marks the end of Kerala. This village beach attracts tourists.","","","Poovar lies very close to Vizhinjam\n, a natural harbor. Poovar has an estuary which connects with the sea during high tides. The 56\u0026#160;km Neyyar River\npasses through Neyyattinkara taluk into the Arabian Sea\nnear Poovar.[1]\n\nIts natural environment enables it to be a tourist spot.[citation needed\n\n\n]\n","Poovar was a trading center of timber, sandalwood, ivory\nand spices. In around 1,000 BCE, it is believed that ships owned by King Solomon\nof Israel landed in Ophir, which is identified by some sources as Poovar,[2]\n\n[3]\n\nwhile the village was one of the ancient Muslim settlements along the western coast of India. The central mosque in Poovar was built by Malik Deenar\n, an eighth century Muslim preacher. During the reign of the Chola dynasty\n, Poovar was a major port. The explorer Megasthenes\n, Roman writer Pliny the Elder\nand Venetian traveller Marco Polo\nmention connections with Greece\nand Rome\n.[3]\n\n","There were a merchant named Pokku Moosa Maraikkar who lived in Poovar during the 18th century in a house called Kallaraickal Tharavad, which many times gave shelter to Marthanda Varma\n(1706–58), king of Travancore\nfrom his enemies. Poovar also had trade relations with international markets at this time as well as a well trained army and some ships. At the Battle of Colachel\nand Battle of Kayamkulam\nthese forces assisted the Travancore army against the Dutch East India Company\nduring the Travancore–Dutch War\n.","The origin of the name \"Poovar\" has a story related to Marthanda Varma. Before that it was called Pokkumoosapuram. During internal riots in Travancore and while escaping from the Ettuveetil Pillamar\n(Lords of the Eight Houses), the king reached Poovar. It was a spring season and the trees on either sides of the Neyyar\nwere full of flowers. These flowers fell into the river making it more attractive.

The site and community who maintained it were also known as the Open Directory Project\n(ODP\n). It was owned by AOL\n(now a part of Verizon\n's Oath Inc.\n) but constructed and maintained by a community\nof volunteer editors.","DMOZ used a hierarchical ontology\nscheme for organizing site listings. Listings on a similar topic were grouped into categories which then included smaller categories.","DMOZ closed on March 17, 2017 because AOL no longer wished to support the project.[2]\n\n[3]\n\nThe website became a single landing page on that day, with links to a static archive of DMOZ, and to the DMOZ discussion forum, where plans to rebrand and relaunch the directory are being discussed.[3]\n\n","As of September\u0026#160;2017[update]\n\n, a non-editable mirror remained available at dmoztools.net,[4]\n\nand it was stated that while the DMOZ URL would not return, a successor version of the directory would, at Curlie.org.[5]\n\n[6]\n\n","","","DMOZ was founded in the United States as Gnuhoo\nby Rich Skrenta\nand Bob Truel\nin 1998 while they were both working as engineers for Sun Microsystems\n. Chris Tolles, who worked at Sun Microsystems as the head of marketing for network security products, also signed on in 1998 as a co-founder of Gnuhoo along with co-founders Bryn Dole and Jeremy Wenokur. Skrenta had developed TASS\n, an ancestor of tin\n, the popular threaded Usenet\nnewsreader for Unix\nsystems. The original category structure of the Gnuhoo directory was based loosely on the structure of Usenet newsgroups then in existence.","The Gnuhoo directory went live on June 5, 1998. After a Slashdot\n\narticle suggested that Gnuhoo had nothing in common with the spirit of free software\n,[7]\n\nfor which the GNU\nproject was known, Richard Stallman and the Free Software Foundation\nobjected to the use of \"Gnu\" in the name and Gnuhoo was changed to NewHoo. Yahoo!\nthen objected to the use of \"Hoo\" in the name, prompting a proposed name change, to ZURL.[8]\n\nPrior to switching to ZURL, NewHoo was acquired by Netscape Communications Corporation\nin October 1998 and became the Open Directory Project. Netscape released Open Directory data under the Open Directory License\n. Netscape was acquired by AOL\nshortly thereafter and DMOZ was one of the assets included in the acquisition.","By the time Netscape assumed stewardship, the Open Directory Project had about 100,000 URLs\nindexed with contributions from about 4500 editors. On October 5, 1999, the number of URLs indexed by DMOZ reached one million. According to an unofficial estimate, the URLs in DMOZ numbered 1.6 million in April 2000, surpassing those in the Yahoo! Directory\n.[9]\n\nDMOZ achieved the milestones of indexing two million URLs on August 14, 2000, three million listings on November 18, 2001 and four million on December 3, 2003. As of April 2013 there were 5,169,995 sites listed in over 1,017,500 categories. On October 31, 2015, there were 3,996,412 sites listed in 1,026,706 categories.","In January 2006, DMOZ began publishing online reports to inform the public about the development of the project. The first report covered the year 2005. Monthly reports were issued subsequently until September 2006.[10]\n\nThese reports gave greater insight into the functioning of the directory than the simplified statistics provided on the front page of the directory. The number of listings and categories cited on the front page included \"Test\" and \"Bookmarks\" categories but these were not included in the RDF dump offered to users. There were about 7330 active editors during August 2006.[10]\n\n75,151 editors had contributed to the directory as of March 31, 2007.[11]\n\nAs of April 2013, the number of contributing editors had increased to 97,584.[11]\n\n","On October 20, 2006, DMOZ's main server suffered a catastrophic failure\n[12]\n\nthat prevented editors from working on the directory until December 18, 2006. During that period, an older build of the directory was visible to the public. On January 13, 2007, the Site Suggestion and Update Listings forms were again made available.[13]\n\nOn January 26, 2007, weekly publication of RDF dumps resumed. To avoid future outages, the system resided on a redundant configuration of two Intel-based servers from then on.[14]\n\n","The site's interface was given an upgrade in 2016, branded \"DMOZ 3.0\" but AOL took it offline the following year.","As DMOZ became more widely known, two other major web directories\nedited by volunteers and sponsored by Go.com\nand Zeal\nemerged, both now defunct. These directories did not license their content for open content\ndistribution.[15]\n\n[16]\n\n","The concept of using a large-scale community of editors to compile online content has been successfully applied to other types of projects. DMOZ's editing model directly inspired at least three other open content volunteer projects: music site MusicMoz, an open content restaurant directory known as ChefMoz\n[17]\n\nand an encyclopedia known as Open Site\n.[18]\n\nFinally, according to Larry Sanger\n, DMOZ was part of the inspiration for the Nupedia\nproject, out of which Wikipedia\ngrew.[19]\n\n","Original logo as from June 1998","Logo after rebranding as NewHoo\n","Logo after acquisition by Netscape","Logo from 1999 to 2014 with the name DMOZ\n","Logo from March 2014","Logo from June 2016 until the closing in March 2017","Gnuhoo borrowed the basic outline for its initial ontology from Usenet\n. In 1998, Rich Skrenta said, \"I took a long list of groups and hand-edited them into a hierarchy.\"[20]\n\nFor example, the topic covered by the comp.ai.alife newsgroup was represented by the category Computers/AI/Artificial_Life. The original divisions were for Adult\n, Arts\n, Business\n, Computers\n, Games\n, Health\n, Home\n, News\n, Recreation\n, Reference\n, Regional\n, Science\n, Shopping\n, Society\n, Sports\nand \"World\". While these sixteen top-level\ncategories have remained intact, the ontology of second- and lower-level categories has undergone a gradual evolution; significant changes are initiated by discussion among editors and then implemented when consensus has been reached.","In July 1998, the directory became multilingual\nwith the addition of the World\ntop-level category. The remainder of the directory lists only English language sites. By May 2005, seventy-five languages were represented. The growth rate of the non-English components of the directory has been greater than the English component since 2002. While the English component of the directory held almost 75% of the sites in 2003, the World\nlevel grew to over 1.5 million sites as of May 2005, forming roughly one-third of the directory. The ontology in non-English categories generally mirrors that of the English directory, although exceptions which reflect language differences are quite common.","Several of the top-level categories have unique characteristics. The Adult\ncategory is not present on the directory homepage but it is fully available in the RDF dump that DMOZ provides. While the bulk of the directory is categorized primarily by topic, the Regional category is categorized primarily by region. This has led many to view DMOZ as two parallel directories: Regional\nand Topical\n.","On November 14, 2000, a special directory within DMOZ was created for people under 18 years of age.[21]\n\nKey factors distinguishing this \"Kids and Teens\" area from the main directory are:","By May 2005, this portion of DMOZ included over 32,000 site listings.","Since early 2004, the whole site has been in UTF-8\nencoding. Prior to this, the encoding used to be ISO 8859-1\nfor English language categories and a language-dependent character set for other languages. The RDF dumps have been encoded in UTF-8 since early 2000.","Directory listings are maintained by editors. While some editors focus on the addition of new listings, others focus on maintaining the existing listings and some do both. This includes tasks such as the editing of individual listings to correct spelling and/or grammatical errors, as well as monitoring the status of linked sites. Still others go through site submissions to remove spam and duplicate submissions.","Robozilla is a Web crawler\nwritten to check the status of all sites listed in DMOZ. Periodically, Robozilla will flag sites which appear to have moved or disappeared and editors follow up to check the sites and take action. This process is critical for the directory in striving to achieve one of its founding goals: to reduce the link rot\nin web directories. Shortly after each run, the sites marked with errors are automatically moved to the unreviewed queue where editors may investigate them when time permits.","Due to the popularity of DMOZ and its resulting impact on search engine\nrankings (See PageRank\n), domains with lapsed registration that are listed on DMOZ have attracted domain hijacking\n, an issue that has been addressed by regularly removing expired domains from the directory.","While corporate funding and staff for DMOZ have diminished in recent years, volunteers have created editing tools such as linkcheckers to supplement Robozilla, category crawlers, spellcheckers, search tools that directly sift a recent RDF dump, bookmarklets\nto help automate some editing functions, mozilla based add-ons,[23]\n\nand tools to help work through unreviewed queues.","DMOZ data was previously made available under the terms of the Open Directory License\n, which required a specific DMOZ attribution table on every Web page that uses the data.","The Open Directory License also included a requirement that users of the data continually check DMOZ site for updates and discontinue use and distribution of the data or works derived from the data once an update occurs. This restriction prompted the Free Software Foundation\nto refer to the Open Directory License\nas a non-free documentation license, citing the right to redistribute a given version not being permanent and the requirement to check for changes to the license.","In 2011, DMOZ silently changed its license to a Creative Commons\nAttribution license[citation needed\n\n\n]\n, which is compatible with the FSF.[24]\n\n","DMOZ data is made available through an RDF-like dump that is published on a download server, older versions are also archived there.[25]\n\nNew versions are usually generated weekly. An DMOZ editor has catalogued a number of bugs that are encountered in the DMOZ RDF dump, most importantly that the file format isn't RDF.[26]\n\nSo while today the so-called RDF dump is valid XML\n, it is not valid RDF\nand as such, software to process the DMOZ RDF dump needs to be specifically written for DMOZ data.","DMOZ data powers the core directory services\nfor many of the Web's largest search engines and portals, including Netscape Search, AOL Search, and Alexa\n. Google Directory\nused DMOZ information, until being shuttered in July 2011.[27]\n\n","Other uses are also made of DMOZ data. For example, in the spring of 2004 Overture\nannounced a search service for third parties combining Yahoo! Directory search results with DMOZ titles, descriptions and category metadata. The search engine Gigablast announced on May 12, 2005 its searchable copy of DMOZ. The technology permits search of websites listed in specific categories, \"in effect, instantly creating over 500,000 vertical search engines\".[28]\n\n","As of 8\u0026#160;September\u0026#160;2006[update]\n\n, DMOZ listed 313 English-language Web sites that use DMOZ data as well as 238 sites in other languages.[29]\n\nHowever, these figures do not reflect the full picture of use, as those sites that use DMOZ data without following the terms of the DMOZ license are not listed.","Restrictions are imposed on who can become an DMOZ editor. The primary gatekeeping mechanism is an editor application process wherein editor candidates demonstrate their editing abilities, disclose affiliations that might pose a conflict of interest\n, and otherwise give a sense of how the applicant would likely mesh with the DMOZ culture and mission.[30]\n\nA majority of applications are rejected but reapplying is allowed and sometimes encouraged. The same standards apply to editors of all categories and subcategories.[citation needed\n\n\n]\n","DMOZ's editing model is a hierarchical\none. Upon becoming editors, individuals will generally have editing permissions in only a small category. Once they have demonstrated basic editing skills in compliance with the Editing Guidelines, they are welcome to apply for additional editing privileges in either a broader category or else another category in the directory. Mentorship relationships between editors are encouraged, and internal forums provide a vehicle for new editors to ask questions.[citation needed\n\n\n]\n","DMOZ has its own internal forums, the contents of which are intended only for editors to communicate with each other primarily about editing topics. Access to the forums requires an editor account and editors are expected to keep the contents of these forums private.[31]\n\n","Over time, senior editors can be granted additional privileges which reflect their editing experience and leadership within the editing community. The most straightforward are editall\nprivileges, which allow an editor to access all categories in the directory. Meta\nprivileges additionally allow editors to perform tasks such as reviewing editor applications, setting category features, and handling external and internal abuse reports. Cateditall\nprivileges are similar to editall\n, but only for a single directory category. Similarly, catmod\nprivileges are similar to meta\n, but only for a single directory category. Catmv\nprivileges allow editors to make changes to directory ontology by moving or renaming categories. All of these privileges are granted by admins and staff, usually after discussion with meta\neditors.[citation needed\n\n\n]\n","In August 2004, a new level of privileges called admin\nwas introduced. Administrator status was granted to a number of long serving metas by staff. Administrators have the ability to grant editall+ privileges to other editors and to approve new directory-wide policies, powers which had previously only been available to root (staff) editors.[32]\n\n","All DMOZ editors are expected to abide by DMOZ's Editing Guidelines. These guidelines describe editing basics: which types of sites may be listed and which may not; how site listings should be titled and described in a loosely consistent manner; conventions for the naming and building of categories; conflict of interest limitations on the editing of sites which the editor may own or otherwise be affiliated with; and a code of conduct within the community.[33]\n\nEditors who are found to have violated these guidelines may be contacted by staff or senior editors, have their editing permissions cut back, or lose their editing privileges entirely. DMOZ Guidelines are periodically revised after discussion in editor forums.[citation needed\n\n\n]\n","There have long been allegations that volunteer DMOZ editors give favorable treatment to their own websites while concomitantly thwarting the good faith efforts of their competition.[34]\n\nSuch allegations are fielded by ODP's staff and meta editors, who have the authority to take disciplinary action against volunteer editors who are suspected of engaging in abusive editing practices.[35]\n\nIn 2003, DMOZ introduced a new Public Abuse Report System\nthat allows members of the general public to report and track allegations of abusive editor conduct using an online form.[36]\n\nUninhibited discussion of DMOZ's purported shortcomings has become more common on mainstream Webmaster discussion forums. Although site policies suggest that an individual site should be submitted to only one category,[37]\n\nas of October 2007, Topix.com, a news aggregation site operated by DMOZ founder Rich Skrenta, had more than 17,000 listings.[38]\n\n","Early in the history of DMOZ, its staff gave representatives of selected companies, such as Rolling Stone\n\nor CNN\n, editing access in order to list individual pages from their websites.[39]\n\nLinks to individual CNN articles were added until 2004, but were entirely removed from the directory in January 2008[40]\n\ndue to the content being outdated and not considered worth the effort to maintain. There have been no similar experiments with the editing policy since then.","Underlying some controversy surrounding DMOZ is its ownership and management. Some of the original GnuHoo volunteers felt that they had been deceived into joining a commercial enterprise.[7]\n\nTo varying degrees, those complaints have continued up until the present.","At DMOZ's inception, there was little thought given to the idea of how DMOZ should be managed and there were no official forums\n, guidelines or FAQs\n. In essence, DMOZ began as a free for all.[41]\n\n","As time went on, the ODP Editor Forums became the de facto\nDMOZ parliament and when one of DMOZ's staff members would post an opinion in the forums, it would be considered an official ruling.[31]\n\nEven so, DMOZ staff began to give trusted senior editors additional editing privileges, including the ability to approve new editor applications, which eventually led to a stratified hierarchy of duties and privileges among DMOZ editors, with DMOZ's paid staff having the final say regarding DMOZ's policies and procedures.[32]\n\n[42]\n\n","Robert Keating, a principal of Touchstone Consulting Group in Washington, D.C. since 2006, has worked as AOL's Program Manager for DMOZ since 2004. He started working for AOL in 1999 as Senior Editor for AOL Search, then as Managing Editor, AOL Search, DMOZ, and then as Media Ecosystem Manager, AOL Product Marketing.[43]\n\n[44]\n\n","DMOZ's editor removal procedures are overseen by DMOZ's staff and meta editors. According to DMOZ's official editorial guidelines, editors are removed for abusive editing practices or uncivil behaviour. Discussions that may result in disciplinary action against volunteer editors take place in a private forum which can only be accessed by DMOZ's staff and meta editors. Volunteer editors who are being discussed are not given notice that such proceedings are taking place.[42]\n\nSome people find this arrangement distasteful, wanting instead a discussion modelled more like a trial held in the U.S. judicial system.[45]\n\n","In the article \"Editor Removal Explained\", DMOZ meta editor Arlarson states that \"a great deal of confusion about the removal of editors from DMOZ results from false or misleading statements by former editors\".[46]\n\n","The DMOZ's confidentiality guidelines prohibit any current DMOZ editors in a position to know anything from discussing the reasons for specific editor removals.[42]\n\nHowever, a generic list of reasons is for example given in the guidelines.[47]\n\nIn the past, this has led to removed DMOZ editors wondering why they cannot login at DMOZ to perform their editing work.[48]\n\n[49]\n\n","David F. Prenatt, Jr., former DMOZ editor netesq\n, and another former editor known by the alias The Cunctator\n, both claim to have been removed for disagreeing with staff about changes to policies, particularly DMOZ's copyright\npolicies. According to their claims, staff use the excuse of uncivil behaviour as a means to remove bothersome editors.[45]\n\n[50]\n\n[51]\n\n","Senior DMOZ editors have the ability to attach \"warning\" or \"do not list\" notes to individual domains but no editor has the unilateral ability to block certain sites from being listed. Sites with these notes might still be listed and at times notes are removed after some discussion.[52]\n\n","Criticism of DMOZ's hierarchical\nstructure emerged by around 2005. Many believe hierarchical directories are too complicated. With the emergence of Web 2.0\n, folksonomies\nbegan to appear, and some editors proposed that folksonomies, networks\nand directed graphs\nare more \"natural\" and easier to manage than hierarchies.[53]\n\n[54]\n\n[55]\n\n","The ODPSearch software is a derivative version of Isearch\nwhich is open source\n, licensed under the Mozilla Public License\n.[56]\n\n","The ODP Editor Forums were originally run on software that was based on the proprietary Ultimate Bulletin Board\nsystem. In June 2003, they switched to the open source phpBB\nsystem. As of 2007, these forums are powered by a modified version of phpBB.","The bug tracking software used by the ODP is Bugzilla\nand the web server Apache\n. Squid\nweb proxy server was also used but it was removed in August 2007 when the storage servers were reorganized. All these applications are open source.","The DMOZ database/editing software is closed source (although Richard Skrenta has said in June 1998 that he was considering licensing it under the GNU General Public License\n). This has led to criticism from the aforementioned GNU project, many of whom also criticized the DMOZ content license. The content was later released under a Creative Commons license, which is compatible with the GNU license.[57]\n\n","As such, there have been some efforts to provide alternatives to DMOZ. These alternatives would allow communities of like-minded editors to set up and maintain their own open source/open content Web directories. However, no significant open source/open content alternative to DMOZ has emerged."]},"downloaded":true}

The creation and growth of OSM has been motivated by restrictions on use or availability of map information across much of the world, and the advent of inexpensive portable satellite navigation\ndevices.[6]\n\nOSM is considered a prominent example of volunteered geographic information\n.","Created by Steve Coast\nin the UK in 2004, it was inspired by the success of Wikipedia[7]\n\nand the predominance of proprietary\nmap data in the UK and elsewhere.[8]\n\nSince then, it has grown to over 2 million registered users,[9]\n\nwho can collect data using manual survey, GPS\ndevices, aerial photography\n, and other free sources. This crowdsourced\ndata is then made available under the Open Database Licence\n. The site is supported by the OpenStreetMap Foundation\n, a non-profit organisation registered in England and Wales.","Rather than the map itself, the data\ngenerated by the OpenStreetMap project is considered its primary output.

In the UK and elsewhere, government-run and tax-funded projects like the Ordnance Survey\ncreated massive datasets but failed to freely and widely distribute them. In April 2006, the OpenStreetMap Foundation\nwas established to encourage the growth, development and distribution of free geospatial\ndata and provide geospatial data for anybody to use and share. In December 2006, Yahoo!\nconfirmed that OpenStreetMap could use its aerial photography\nas a backdrop for map production.[14]\n\n","In April 2007, Automotive Navigation Data\n(AND) donated a complete road data set for the Netherlands\nand trunk road\ndata for India\nand China to the project[15]\n\nand by July 2007, when the first OSM international The State of the Map conference was held, there were 9,000 registered users. Sponsors of the event included Google\n, Yahoo! and Multimap\n. In October 2007, OpenStreetMap completed the import of a US Census\nTIGER\nroad dataset.[16]\n\n[17]\n\nIn December 2007, Oxford University\nbecame the first major organisation to use OpenStreetMap data on their main website.[18]\n\n","Ways to import and export data have continued to grow – by 2008, the project developed tools to export OpenStreetMap data to power portable GPS units, replacing their existing proprietary and out-of-date maps.[19]\n\nIn March, two founders[clarification needed\n\n\n]\nannounced that they have received venture capital funding of €2.4\u0026#160;\nmillion for CloudMade, a commercial company that uses OpenStreetMap data.[20]\n\nIn November 2010, Bing\nchanged their licence to allow use of their satellite imagery for making maps.[21]\n\n","In 2012, the launch of pricing for Google Maps\nled several prominent websites to switch from their service to OpenStreetMap and other competitors.[22]\n\nChief amongst these were Foursquare\n, Craigslist\nwho adopted OpenStreetMap, and Apple\n, which ended a contract with Google and launched a self-built mapping platform which uses TomTom\nand OpenStreetMap data.[23]\n\n","Map data is collected from scratch by volunteers performing systematic ground surveys using tools such as a handheld GPS unit, a notebook, digital camera, or a voice recorder. The data is then entered into the OpenStreetMap database. Mapathon\ncompetition events are also held by OpenStreetMap team and by non-profit organisations and local governments to map a particular area.","The availability of aerial photography and other data from commercial and government sources has added important sources of data for manual editing and automated imports. Special processes are in place to handle automated imports and avoid legal and technical problems.[24]\n\n","Editing of maps can be done using the default web browser editor called iD\n, an HTML5\napplication using D3.js\nand written by Mapbox\n[25]\n\nand originally financed by the Knight Foundation\n[26]\n\n.

In April 2012, OpenStreetMap cleared 600,000 registered contributors.[30]\n\nOn 6 January 2013, OpenStreetMap reached 1 million registered users.[31]\n\nAround 30% of users have contributed at least one point to the OpenStreetMap database.[32]\n\n","Ground surveys are performed by a mapper, on foot\n, bicycle, or in a car\n, motorcycle or boat. Map data are usually collected using a GPS unit, although this is not strictly necessary if an area has already been traced from satellite imagery.","Once the data has been collected, it is entered into the database by uploading it onto the project's website together with appropriate attribute data. As collecting and uploading data may be separated from editing objects, contribution to the project is possible without using a GPS unit.","Some committed contributors adopt the task of mapping whole towns and cities, or organising mapping parties to gather the support of others to complete a map area. A large number of less active users contribute corrections and small additions to the map.","Some government agencies have released official data on appropriate licences. This includes the United States, where works of the federal government are placed under public domain\n.[33]\n\n","In the United States, OSM uses Landsat 7\nsatellite imagery, Prototype Global Shorelines from NOAA\n, and TIGER\nfrom the Census.

culture of Kerala\n\nis a synthesis of Aryan\nand Dravidian\ncultures, developed and mixed for centuries, under influences from other parts of India and abroad.[1]\n\n[2]\n\nIt is defined by its antiquity and the organic continuity sustained by the Malayali people\n.[3]\n\nModern Kerala society took shape owing to migrations from different parts of India and abroad throughout Classical Antiquity\n.[2]\n\n[4]\n\n[5]\n\n","Kerala traces its non-prehistoric cultural genesis to its membership (around the AD 3rd century) in a vaguely defined historical region known as Thamizhagom\n— a land defined by a common Tamil culture\nand encompassing the Chera, Chola, and Pandya kingdoms. At that time, the music, dance, language (first Dravida Bhasha\n— \"Dravidian language\"[6]\n\n— then Tamil), and Sangam\n\n(a vast corpus of Tamil literature composed between 1,500–2,000 years ago) found in Kerala were all similar to that found in the rest of Thamizhagom\n(today's Tamil Nadu). The culture of Kerala evolved through the Sanskritization\nof Dravidian ethos, revivalism\nof religious movements and reform movements\nagainst caste discrimination\n.[7]\n\n[8]\n\n[9]\n\nKerala showcases a culture unique to itself developed through accommodation, acculturation and assimilation of various faculties of civilized lifestyle.","","","Native traditions of classical performing arts\ninclude koodiyattom\n\n, a form of Sanskrit\ndrama\nor theatre\nand a UNESCO\n-designated Human Heritage Art. Kathakali (from katerumbu\n(\"story\") and kali\n(\"performance\")) is a 500-year-old form of dance\n-drama\nthat interprets ancient epics; a popularized offshoot of kathakali\nis Kerala natanam\n\n(developed in the 20th century by dancer\nGuru Gopinath\n). Meanwhile, koothu\n\nis a more light-hearted performance mode, akin to modern stand-up comedy\n; an ancient art originally confined to temple sanctuaries, it was later popularized by Mani Madhava Chakyar\n. Other Keralite performing arts include mohiniyaattam\n\n(\"dance of the enchantress\"), which is a type of graceful choreographed\ndance performed by women and accompanied by musical vocalizations. Thullal\n\n, Thirayattam\n\n, padayani\n\n, and theyyam\n\nare other important Keralite performing arts.Thirayattam\nis one of the most outstanding Ethnic art of kerala\n. This vibrant ritualistic annual performing art form enacted in courtyards of \"Kaavukal\"(sacred groves) and village shrine.[10]\n\n","Kerala also has several tribal and folk art forms. For example, Kummattikali\nis the famous colorful mask-dance of South Malabar, performed during the festival of Onam. The Kannyar Kali\ndances (also known as Desathukali) are fast moving, militant dances attuned to rhythmic devotional folk songs and asuravadyas. Also important are various performance genres that are Islam\n- or Christianity-themed. These include oppana\n\n, which is widely popular among Keralite Muslims and is native to Malabar. Oppana\n\nincorporates group dance accompanied by the beat of rhythmic hand clapping and ishal\nvocalizations.","Margam Kali\nis one of the ancient round group dance of Kerala practiced by Saint Thomas Christians\n.[11]\n\n","However, many of these native art forms largely play to tourists or at youth festivals, and are not as popular among ordinary Keralites. Thus, more contemporary forms — including those heavily based on the use of often risqué and politically incorrect\nmimicry\nand parody\n— have gained considerable mass appeal in recent years.[citation needed\n\n\n]\nIndeed, contemporary artists often use such modes to mock socioeconomic elites. In recent decades, Malayalam cinema\n, yet another mode of widely popular artistic expression, have provided a distinct and indigenous Keralite alternative to both Bollywood\nand Hollywood\n.","The ragas\n\nand talas\n\nof lyrical and devotional Carnatic music\n— another native product of South India — dominates Keralite classical musical genres. Swathi Thirunal Rama Varma\n, a 19th-century king of Travancore and patron and composer of music, was instrumental in popularising carnatic music in early Kerala.[12]\n\n[13]\n\nAdditionally, Kerala has its own native music system, sopanam\n, which is a lugubrious and step-by-step rendition of raga-based songs. It is Sopanam\n\n, for example, that provides the background music used in Kathakali\n\n. The wider traditional music of Kerala\nalso includes melam\n\n(including the paandi\nand panchari\nvariants), as style of percussive\nmusic performed at temple\n-centered festivals using an instrument known as the chenda\n\n. Up to 150 musicians may comprise the ensembles staging a given performance; each performance, in turn, may last up to four hours. Panchavadyam\n\nis a differing type of percussion ensemble consisting of five types of percussion instruments; these can be utilised by up to one hundred artists in certain major festivals. In addition to these, percussive music is also associated with various uniquely Keralite folk arts forms. Lastly, the popular music\nof Kerala — as in the rest of India — is dominated by the filmi\n\nmusic of Indian cinema\n. The most remembered name in kerala music culture is of Great Indian musician Sri K. J. Yesudas\n.","Malayalam literature\nis ancient in origin, and includes such figures as the 14th century Niranam poets\n(Madhava Panikkar, Sankara Panikkar and Rama Panikkar), whose works mark the dawn of both modern Malayalam language and indigenous Keralite poetry. The Triumvirate of poets\n(Kavithrayam\n: Kumaran Asan\n, Vallathol Narayana Menon\nand Ulloor S. Parameswara Iyer\n) are recognized for moving keralian poetry away from archaic sophistry\nand metaphysics\nand towards a more lyrical\nmode. Poets like Changampuzha\n, Cherusseri\nand Edappally Raghavan Pillai\nalso contributed to bring Malayalam\npoetry to the common man. Later, such contemporary writers as Booker Prize\nwinner Arundhati Roy\n(whose 1996 semi-autobiographical\nbestseller The God of Small Things\n\nis set in the Kottayam\ntown of Ayemenem) have garnered international recognition. From 1970 to early 1990s, a lot of Malayalam Novelists and story writers contributed to the Literature of Kerala. The contributions from Thakazhi Sivashankara Pillai\n, P. Kesavadev\n, Uroob\n, OV Vijayan\n, T Padmanabhan\n, Sethu\n, Perumbadavam Sreedharan\n, Kovilan\n, M. Mukundan\n, Kakkanadan\n, Anand\nand Paul Zacharia\n, have been remarkable. Significant contributions from poets and songwriters such as Vayalar Rama Varma\n, P. Bhaskaran\nand ONV Kurup\nhave influenced contemporary literature. Critics such as Kuttikrishna Marar\nand M.P. Paul\ntill the sixties and later, M Krishnan Nair\n, S. Gupthan Nair\n, M. K. Sanu\n, Sukumar Azhikode\n, K.P. Appan\n, Narendra Prasad\nand M. Leelavathy\nhave added value by providing critical analysis of the books written during the recent past.","The folklore of Kerala includes elements from the traditional lifestyle of the people of Kerala. The traditional beliefs, customs,rituals etc. are reflected in the folkart and songs of Kerala. Kerala has a rich tradition of Folklore.[14]\n\nFolklore in this region is a spontaneous expression of human behavior and thoughts. Generally speaking, Folklore could be defined as the lore of the common people who had been marginalized during the reign of feudal Kings. The Keralites have their culture and lore which were mostly part of agricultural. Sowing, planting of nharu (seedling), clearing out the weeds, harvests etc. are the different stages of agriculture which have their typical rituals. Numerous songs and performing arts are accompanied with them. Kanyar Kali, Padayani\n, Mudiyettu\n, Thirayattam\n, Malavayiyattam, Theyyam\n, Kothamooriyattam, Nira, Puthari, etc. are some of the ritual folklore of Kerala. It was under the rule of Kolathiris\n, the Kings of Kolathunadu\n, and they codified the rituals, beliefs, taboos and folk performing arts. Even the dates of specific fertility rituals and folk performances were decided by the Kolathiris of which many are continuing even today.The Theyyam\nfestivals, even now, are conducted as per the dates once fixed by the King.","The folk arts of Kerala can be broadly classified under two heads:[15]\n\nritualistic and non-ritualistic. Ritualistic folk arts can be further divided into two: devotional and magical. Devotional folk arts are performed to propitiate a particular God or Goddess. Theyyam\n, thirayattam\n, poothamthira, kanyarkali, kummatti\n, etc., are some of them. Forms like panappattu and thottampattu are composed in the form of songs. In kolkali, margamkali\n, daffumuttukkali\n, etc., the ritualistic element is not very strong. Magical folk arts seek to win general prosperity for a community or exorcise evil spirits or to beget children. Gandharvas\nand nagas\nare worshipped in order to win these favours. The magical folk arts include pambinthullal, pooppadathullal, kolamthullal, malayankettu, etc.","(Malayalam: ???) Onam is a harvest festival celebrated extravagantly by the people of Kerala, India. It is also the state festival of Kerala with State holidays on 4 days starting from Onam Eve (Uthradom) to the 4th Onam Day. Onam Festival falls during the Malayalam\nmonth of Chingam (Aug - Sep) and marks the commemoration of Vamana\navatara of Vishnu and the subsequent homecoming of King Mahabali\n, who Malayalees consider to be just and fair King who was exiled to the underworld. Onam is reminiscent of Kerala's agrarian past, as it is considered to be a harvest festival. It is one of the festivals celebrated with most number of cultural elements. Some of them are Vallam Kali, Pulikkali, Pookkalam, Onatthappan, Thumbi Thullal, Onavillu\n, Kazhchakkula, Onapottan, Atthachamayame etc.","Another distinct feature of the festival is 'Ona Sadhya' (Onam Feast) and consists of numerous dishes served on banana leaf and 'Ona Kodi' (new dress for the special occasion). Usual the Ona Sadhya consist of numerous side dishes along with rice and Ona Kodi is traditional dress. Both are eagerly observed by the youth with excitement.","The people of Kerala are very fond of politics. Majority of keralites belong to either one of the political alliances namely United Democratic Front\n(UDF) or Left Democratic Front\n(LDF). Bharatiya Janatha Party\n(BJP), a national party, also has good following. Regional parties such as Indian Union Muslim League\n(IUML), various factions of Kerala Congress\n, various factions of Revolutionary Socialist Party\nand a host of smaller parties add spice to Kerala political scene. Religious leaders have high influence in Kerala political movements. For many Keralites it's nostalgic to remember the political discussions and debates they had done in the 'chaya kada\n' (local tea shops were youngsters go to sip a cup and read newspapers) in their younger ages.","Being the state with the highest literacy rate and education level in the country, the Kerala society has moved from its agricultural background. Although Kerala remains fairly liberal in its outlook and open to modern ideas,and technological changes, the State largely remains conservative on social issues.","Kerala also has its own indigenous form of martial art\n- Kalarippayattu\n, derived from the words kalari\n\n(\"place\", \"threshing floor\", or \"battlefield\") and payattu\n(\"exercise\" or \"practice\"). Influenced by both Kerala’s Brahminical past and Ayurvedic medicine, kalaripayattu\nis attributed by oral tradition to Parasurama. After some two centuries of suppression by British colonial authorities, it is now experiencing strong comeback among Keralites while also steadily gaining worldwide attention. Other popular ritual arts include theyyam\n\nand poorakkali\n\n— these originate from northern Malabar, which is the northernmost part of Kerala. Nevertheless, these have in modern times been largely supplanted by more popular sports such as cricket\n, kabaddi\n, soccer\n, badminton\n, and others. 'Kochi Tuskers Kerala\n' playing in the Indian Premier League (IPL) is from Kerala. Kerala is home of the football clubs Kerala Blasters\n, Viva Kerala\nand FC Kochin\n.","Kerala also has an indigenous ancient solar calendar — the Malayalam calendar\n— which is used in various communities primarily for timing agricultural and religious activities.","The elephants\nare an integral part of the culture and daily life in Kerala. These Indian elephants\nare given a prestigious place in the state's culture. They are often christened names by which they're known across the entire state. Elephants in Kerala are often referred to as the 'sons of the sahya\n'\nand are indispensable for temple festivals. The elephant is the state animal of Kerala and is featured on the emblem of the Government of Kerala\n.","Sarpa Kavu\n(meaning Sacred Grove of the Serpent\n) is a typically small traditional grove of trees seen in the Kerala\nstate of South India\n. These pristine groves usually have representations of several Naga Devatas\n(serpent gods\n), which were worshipped by the joint families or taravads\n. This was part of Nagaradhana\n(snake worship) which was prevalent among Keralites\nduring past centuries. It had been practised by Thiyyas, Perumannans, Nairs\n, Arayas\nand many other tribal, non-tribal and coastal communities all over the Malabar Coast\nin South India\n. snake was considered as god and the people worshipped on them for getting blessings","Kerala\nhas a large number of temples. The temples celebrate annual festivals which are not only unique to the region but sometimes have features that are unique to each temple. Each temple describes each interesting history behind its creation. In the Malabar, distinct art form called Theyyam\nattract tourists, and mini carnivals are also held along with temple festivals. Temple festivals are taken up with great pride by the residents and patrons of the temple and celebrated with much ado."]},"downloaded":true}

Most of Kerala\n's 33.3\u0026#160;million people (in 2011) are of Malayali\n(Malayalam language\nspeaking) ethnicity. Most of the Malayalam and English speaking Keralites derive their ancestry from Dravidian\nand Aryan\ncommunities that settled in Kerala and intermixed with each other and existing populations.[1]\n\nAdditional ancestries derive from several centuries of contact with non-Indian lands, whereby people of Arab\n, Jewish\n, and other ethnicities settled in Kerala. Many of these immigrants intermarried\nwith native Malayalam speakers.[2]\n\n[3]\n\nA tiny number of Muslims thus take lineage from Arab settlers mixed with local population.","Malayalam\nis Kerala's official language\nand is spoken by at least 96% of the people of Kerala; the next most common languages are Hindi\nand Tamil\n, spoken mainly by migrant\nworkers from North and eastern parts of India and also from the neighbouring state of Tamil Nadu. Tulu\nand Kannada\nis spoken in most parts of the northern district of Kasaragod, adjoining Karnataka\n. In addition, Kerala is home to 321,000 indigenous tribal Adivasis\n\n(1.10% of the populace).[4]\n\nSome 63% of tribals reside in the eastern districts of Wayanad (where 35.82% are tribals), Palakkad (1.02%), and Idukki (15.66%).[5]\n\nThese groups, including the Irulars, Kurumbars\n, and Mudugars,[6]\n\nspeak their own native languages.[7]\n\n[8]\n\n[9]\n\nCholanaikkan\ntribe in the Silent Valley National Park\nwere contacted\nonly in the 1970s and they are the most isolated tribe in the state.","","","Kerala is home to 2.76% of India's people, and — at 859 persons per km²;[10]\n\nits land is three times as densely settled as the rest of India. However, Kerala's population growth rate\nis far lower than the national average. Whereas Kerala's population more than doubled between 1951 and 1991 — adding 15.6\u0026#160;million people to reach a total of 29.1\u0026#160;million residents in 1991 — the population stood at 31.8 million by 2001 and 33.3 million in 2011.[10]\n\nKerala's people are most densely settled in the coastal region, leaving the eastern hills and mountains comparatively sparsely populated.[11]\n\n","Hinduism\nis followed by the majority of Keralites (54.7%).Kerala is home to Hindu saints and swamis of all castes. Jagatguru Sree Adi Shankaracharya, Sree Narayana Guru, Sree Chattambi Swamikal and Vaikunda Swami were the first among the saints of Kerala. The major religions followed in Kerala are Hinduism\n(54.7% — Hinduism of Kerala\n), Islam\n(26.6%) and Christianity\n(18.4%).[12]\n\nKerala also had a tiny Jewish population\nuntil recently, said to date from 587 BC when they fled the occupation of Jerusalem\nby Nebuchadnezzar\n.[13]\n\nThe 2001 Indian census recorded only 51 Jews in Kerala. The synagogue\nin Kochi\nis the oldest in the Commonwealth of Nations\n. The state has many famous Temples\n, Mosques\n, and Churches\n. The oldest church in India is found in Kerala, believed to be established by St. Thomas the disciple of Jesus Christ and the first Mosque in India as well.","Kerala ranks highest in India with respect to social development indices such as elimination of poverty, primary education\nand healthcare. This resulted from significant efforts begun in 1911 by the erstwhile Princely states of Cochin\nand Travancore\nto boost healthcare and education among the people and aided by the Christian missionaries. This central focus — unusual in India — was then maintained after Kerala's post-independence inauguration as a state.[14]\n\nThus, Kerala has the highest literacy rate in India of 93.91% (2011);[15]\n\nand life expectancy is now the highest in India.The suicide rates in Kerala are the highest in India,[16]\n\n. As per the 2011 census, Kerala and Puducherry are the only states in India with a female-to-male ratio\nhigher than 0.99. The ratio for Kerala is 1.084 — 1084 females per 1000 males — while the national figure is 0.940.[17]\n\n.It is also one of the state in India to have sub-replacement fertility\n. [18]\n\nUNICEF\nand the World Health Organization\n(WHO) designated Kerala the world's first \"baby-friendly state\" via its \"Baby Friendly Hospital Initiative\n\". The state is also known for Ayurveda\n, a traditional system of medicine\n— this traditional expertise is currently drawing increasing numbers of medical tourists\n. However, drawbacks to this situation includes the population's steady aging — indeed, 11.2% of Keralites are age 60 or over.[14]\n\n","Kerala's unusual socioeconomic and demographic situation was summarized by author\nand environmentalist\nBill McKibben\n:[19]\n\n","Kerala, a state in India, is a bizarre anomaly among developing nations, a place that offers real hope for the future of the Third World. Though not much larger than Maryland, Kerala has a population as big as California's and a per capita annual income of less than $300 mn dollar. But its infant mortality rate is very low, its literacy rate among the highest on Earth, and its birthrate below America's and falling faster. Kerala's residents live nearly as long as Americans or Europeans. Though mostly a land of paddy-covered plains, statistically Kerala stands out in social development; there's truly no place like it.","As of 2011, a total of 2,280,000 Keralites reside outside India. Largest populations are found in UAE (883,313) and USA (680,076).[20]\n\n","As of 2011, the major concentrations of expat Keralites are in the following nations:[21]\n\n","There are more than 1,000,000 migrants living in Kerala,[22]\n\nmostly from Assam\nand West Bengal\n, constituting more than 8% of the population. There are also migrants from Bihar, Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh, Orissa, and the North East.[23]\n\nIn some places like Perumbavoor\nthey outnumber the locals.[24]\n\nSome alarmist have even wrote that \"of late, Kerala has been hearing more Bengali\nthan its own local language\"\n,[25]\n\nwhich is a huge exaggeration, since there are very few migrants in Northern and Southern Kerala. Most of the migrants tend to concentrate around central Kerala, especially in Kochi\n(Notable exceptions would be Thiruvananthapuram\nand Kozhikode\n. In Kozhikode, northern immigrants constitute more than 8% of the total population, at 35,000).[22]\n\n","Studies indicate that by the time of 2016 state elections\n, migrants will become a crucial voting block in many of the constituencies in Thiruvananthapuram, Kochi, Kozhikode, Thrissur and Kannur.[26]\n\n","The following is a list of most populous urban agglomerations\nin the Kerala\nstate of India. Population statistics indicated in this article as of 2001 census.[27]\n\n[28]\n\n[29]\n\n[30]\n\nNote that this is a list of metropolitan population and does not indicate the city populations. For that, see List of most populous cities in India\n.","Kerala has seven million-plus cities: Kochi\n, Kozhikode\n, Thrissur\n, Malappuram\n, Thiruvananthapuram\n, Kannur\nand Kollam\n. Over a third of Keralites live in these large cities (a higher percentage than any other state), and over half the population lives in urban centres.[31]\n\n","\n\n\nThiruvananthapuram\n\n\n\n\nKochi\n\n\n\n\nKozhikode\n\n","\n","\n\n\nThrissur\n\n","\n","According to World Gazetteer[33]\n\npopulation calculation for the year 2010, five of the top 100 most populous metropolitan areas in India belong to Kerala. They are Kochi, Thiruvananthapuram, Kozhikode, Kannur\nand Kollam\nranking 26, 43, 46, 73 and 86 respectively.","The great majority of residents of Kerala are Malayalis\n, but there are many smaller ethnic groups including Tuluvas\n, Tamils\n, Kannadigas\nand Konkanis\n. In addition, as of early 2013 there are close to 2.5 million (7.5% of state population) migrant workers from other states of India in Kerala.[34]\n\n","The Scheduled Caste (SC) population of Kerala State is 3,123,941 which is 9.8% of overall population. Scheduled Tribes in Kerala with a population of 3.64 lakh constitute 1.14% of the population of state. Denominations groups among Christians [40]\n\n","Catholic church (Syrian and Latin rites) is the largest denomination among Kerala Christians. Malankara orthodox church, Jacobite Syrian orthodox church and Marthomite Syrian church denominations claim Syrian roots. Major Protestant groups are: Church of South India(C.S.I.) and various Pentecostal churches are major Protestant churches.Chaldean, Seventh Day Adventists, Salvation army etc. are some of the other denominations. Denominations should not be considered as caste or ethnic groups. Caste groups among Christians, which is a continuation of casteism in Hinduism, runs parallel to denominational divisions. One caste group may be spread over many denominations. One denomination may have more than one caste group in it. Person belonging to a denomination can convert to another denomination. Hence definitely these are not ethnic divisions.[41]\n\n","Calden Syrian (paavu m pillerum)=12% Mayukh= only one","54.73% of Kerala's residents are Hindus who contribute 42.87% of the total child births, 26.56% are Muslims who contribute to 41.45% of total child births, 18.38% are Christians who contribute 15.42% of the total child births, and the remaining 0.32% others contribute 0.26% of the total child births.","\n","Birth Rate was 17.1 in 1994-2001 (20.3 in 1984-1990 \u0026amp; 25.0 in 1974-1980) .

the thirteenth largest economy\nin India. Service industry\ndominates the Kerala\neconomy. Kerala's per capita GDP in 2013-14 is Rs. 103820.[3]\n\nKerala's low GDP and productivity figures juxtaposed with higher development figures than in most Indian states is often dubbed the \"Kerala Phenomenon\n\" or the \"Kerala Model\n\" of development by economists, political scientists, and sociologists. This phenomenon arises mainly from Kerala's land reforms, social upliftment of entire communities and reforms introduced by the communist party which held the state for a long period of time.[4]\n\nSome describe Kerala's economy as a \"democratic socialist\nwelfare state\n\". Some, such as Financial Express, use the term \"Money Order Economy\".[5]\n\nKerala's economic progress is above the national average, but relatively few major corporations and manufacturing plants are headquartered in Kerala. Estimates of the 2013 Tendulkar Committee Report on poverty suggest that percentages of population below poverty line in rural and urban Kerala are 9.14% and 4.97%","Around 3,000,000 Keralites are working abroad, mainly in Persian Gulf\n; to where migration started with the Gulf Boom\n. The Kerala Economy is therefore largely dependent on trade in services and resulted remittances\n.[6]\n\n[7]\n\n[8]\n\nIn 2012, the state was the highest receiver of overall remittances to India\nwhich stood at Rs.49,965 Crore (31.2% of the State's GDP), followed by Tamil Nadu, Punjab and Uttar Pradesh.[9]\n\nS. Irudaya Rajan describes the situation as \"Remittances from global capitalism are carrying the whole Kerala economy\".[6]\n\nWith 11.8% of the labour force unemployed in 2015, Kerala is 11th in unemployment in India.[10]\n\nUnderemployment\n, low employability of youths, and a 13.5% female participation rate\nare chronic issues.[11]\n\n:5, 13\n\n[12]\n\nThe 'Report on Fifth Annual Employment - Unemployment Survey for 2015-16' prepared by the labour bureau of the Union ministry of labour and employment indicates that Tripura had the highest unemployment rate of 19.7% in India, followed by Sikkim (18.1%) and Kerala (12.5%).","","","This is a chart of trend of gross state domestic product of Kerala at market prices estimated\nby Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation\nwith figures in millions of Indian Rupees.Kerala had recorded a growth rate of 6.49 per cent in 2013, which was above the national average (4.04) and the second highest among South Indian States. The state’s growth rate was above that of Karnataka (5.79 per cent) and Andhra Pradesh (5.97 per cent).","The state's debt was estimated at 29.53 per cent of GDP in 2013.[14]\n\nState's debt liability recorded an increase of 14.4 per cent and rose from Rs 1,24,081 crore in 2013-14 to Rs 1,41,947 crore in 2014-15. This liability as a percentage of GSDP was 31.4 per cent, which is higher than the target of 29.8 per cent fixed in the Kerala Fiscal Responsibility Act.[15]\n\n","Kerala produces 97% of national output of pepper\nand accounts for 85% of the area under natural rubber\nin the country.[16]\n\nCoconut\n, tea, coffee, cashew\n, and spices\n— including cardamom\n, vanilla\n, cinnamon\n, and nutmeg\n— comprise a critical agricultural sector. A key agricultural staple is rice, with some six hundred varieties grown in Kerala's extensive paddy fields.[17]\n\nNevertheless, home gardens\ncomprise a significant portion of the agricultural sector. Related animal husbandry\nis also important, and is touted by proponents as a means of alleviating rural poverty and unemployment among women, the marginalised, and the landless. Feeding, milking, breeding, management, health care, and concomitant micro-enterprises all provide work for around 3.2\u0026#160;million of Kerala's 5.5\u0026#160;million households.[citation needed\n\n\n]\nThe state government seeks to promote such activity via educational campaigns and the development of new cattle breeds such as Sunandini\n.","The most essential or the staple crop is the rice or paddy. About 600 varieties of rice are grown in the sprawling paddy fields of Kerala. In fact the Kuttanad region of the district of Kerala is known as the 'rice bowl of the state' and enjoys a significant status in the production of rice.","Next to rice is Tapioca and is cultivated mainly in the drier regions. Tapioca is a major food of the Keralites. Besides production of the main crop, Kerala is also a major producer of spices that form the cash crops of the state.The important spices are cardamom, cinnamon, clove, turmeric, nutmeg and vanilla.","Other cash crops that constitute the agricultural sector include tea, coffee cashew, pulses, areca nut, ginger and coconut. In fact coconut provides the principal source of income in Kerala- from coir industry to coconut shell artifacts. Cashew is also an essential cash crop. Kottayam district has extensive areas producing and processing rubber. Apart from rubber, other plantation crop likes plantains or bananas are also grown in plenty.","National Sample Survey Organization (NSSO) conducted a Situation Assessment Survey in 2013. According to their data, as opposed to 57.8% of national households declaring themselves as agricultural, 27.3% did so in Kerala. And of those households in Kerala, nearly two-thirds earn income from activities other than agriculture.When statistics sum up the state earns 30 percent of its income from agriculture.","In 1960-61, Kerala contributed to nearly 70% of the country’s coconut production. In 2011-12, it was at 42%. It dropped further by 2.3% points the next year. According to the State Planning Board (2011) data, the state is producing only about 12% of its total requirement for rice. In 1960-61 Kerala produced more than 10 lakh tons of rice. By 2012-13 rice production was down to 5.08 lakh tons. By 2012-13, in just a single year, area under rice cultivation had declined by 5.2%, and the production itself dropped by 10.2%.","The government enforces state monopoly over liquor sale in the state, after the state banned foreign liquor shops, through the government owned Kerala State Beverages Corporation (KSBC)\n. Every year, liquor sales have been rising and the total sales of liquor and beer during 2010-11 fiscal year was expected to be about Rs. 67\u0026#160;billion.[18]\n\n","The government applies the highest state tax on liquor (around 120%). The total revenue from taxes on liquor was Rs. 55.39\u0026#160;billion in 2009-10. Rum\nand brandy\nare the preferred drinks in Kerala in a country where whisky\noutsells every other liquor. Taxes on alcohol was a major source of revenue for the state government, but of late, it has been showing a declining trend. Only 4.2% of revenues for its annual budget come from liquor sales. Revenues from alcohol to the state's exchequer have registered a 100% rise over the past four years.[19]\n\n","Liquor sales stood at 201 lakh cases worth Rs.11,577 crore during 2015-16, down from 220 lakh cases worth Rs.10,013 crore during the previous year. Gross sales during the first three months of 2016 were around Rs.4,000 crore.[20]\n\n","Kerala is an established tourist destination for both Indians and non-Indians alike. Tourism contributes to nearly 10% of the state's GSDP. Tourists mostly visit, Fort Kochi\n, Mattanchery\n, Cherai\n, Kappad\n, Kovalam, the hill stations\nof Munnar\n, Nelliampathi\n, Wayanad\nand Ponmudi\n, and national parks and wildlife sanctuaries such as Periyar\nand Eravikulam National Park\n. The \"backwaters\n\" region – an extensive network of interlocking rivers, lakes, and canals that center on Veli\n, Akkulam\n, Ashtamudi\n, Alleppey\n, Kumarakom\n, and Punnamada – also see heavy tourist traffic. Examples of Keralite architecture, such as the Padmanabhapuram Palace\n, Malik Deenar Mosque\nKasaragod\n, Paradesi Synagogue\nare also visited.

Tourism plays an important role in the state's economy. Kerala is also a preferred destination for night dwellers and the nightlife districts in Trivandrum\n, Kozhikode\n, Thrissur\n, Kottayam\nand Kollam\nare the major centres. Along with tourism there is also a new trend of domestic pilgrimage tourism visible in Kerala in recent years during the annual Sabarimala\npilgrimage season and round the year to temples such as Padmanabhaswamy Temple\nThiruvananthapuram\n, Guruvayur Temple\nThrissur\netc.","In a state of 32 million where unemployment approaches 20 percent, one out of six employed Keralite now works overseas. As of 2008, the Gulf countries altogether have a Keralite population of more than 2.5 million, who send home annually a sum of USD\n9.25 billion,[22]\n\nwhich is more than 15.13% of Remittance to India in 2008\n. Large numbers work in construction. High literacy allows Keralites to secure administrative employment \u0026amp; white collar jobs. Foreign remittances augment the state's economic output by nearly 25 percent. Migrants' families are three times as likely as those of nonmigrants to live in superior housing, and about twice as likely to have telephones, refrigerators and cars.[23]\n\nPathanamthitta\nand Thrissur\ndistricts have on an average one member from each household a non-resident Indian.","Of the $71 billion in remittances sent to India in 2012, Kerala still received the highest among the states: $11.3 billion, which is nearly 16%.[24]\n\n","The survey conducted by the Centre for Development Studies (CDS), Thiruvananthapuram, in 2016 pointed out that foreign remittances in Kerala in 2014 was estimated to be Rs. 71,142 crores which dropped to Rs.63,289 crores in 2016.","According to a study commissioned by the Kerala State Planning Board\n, the state should look for other reliable sources instead of relying on remittances to finance its expenditure.[25]\n\n","Kerala is the single largest originator of education loans for the country as a whole.Total disbursal of education loans amount to Rs. 60\u0026#160;billion.[26]\n\n","Kerala has 145,704\u0026#160;km of roads (4.2% of India's total). This translates into about 4.62\u0026#160;km of road per thousand population, compared to an all-India average of 2.59\u0026#160;km. Virtually all of Kerala's villages are connected by road. Traffic in Kerala has been growing at a rate of 10–11% every year, resulting in high traffic and pressure on the roads. Total road length in Kerala increased by 5% between 2003-2004. The road density in Kerala is nearly four times the national average, and is a reflection of Kerala's unique settlement patterns. India's national highway network includes a Kerala-wide total of 1,524\u0026#160;km, which is only 2.6% of the national total. There are eight designated national highways in the state. Upgrading and maintenance of 1,600\u0026#160;km of state highways and major district roads have been taken up under the Kerala State Transport Project (KSTP), which includes the GIS\n-based Road Information and Management Project (RIMS).

importance and antiquity of education in Kerala\nis underscored by the state's ranking as among the most literate in the country. The local dynastic precursors of modern-day Kerala\n- primarily the Travancore Royal Family, the Christian missionaries, The Nair Service Society\n,[1]\n\nSree Narayana Dharma Paripalana\nYogam[2]\n\n(SNDP Yogam) and Muslim Educational Society\n(MES)[3]\n\n- made significant contributions to the progress on education in Kerala.[4]\n\nThere were many sabha mathams\nthat imparted Vedic\nknowledge. Apart from kalaris\n, which taught martial arts, there were village schools run by Ezhuthachans or Asans. Christian missionaries brought the modern school education system to Kerala.","Education in Kerala had been promoted during British rule in India by Christian\nmissionaries who were keen on providing education to all sections of society and on strengthening of women, without any kind of discrimination. The contributions of Catholic priests and nuns has been crucial and has played a major role in the education of women and members of lower strata of society, resulting in the surpassing of many social hurdles. A significant figure in the 19th century was Rev.fr. Kuriakose Elias Chavara\n,[5]\n\nwho started a system called \"A school along with every church\" to make education available for both poor and rich. That system still continues in the present. His work has resulted in the promotion of education for girls and has become a model for the educational system in Kerala after independence. Kerala's high literacy rate is attributed to a high literacy rate among girls; as it is said, \"When a woman is educated, she will make sure that her children are well-educated.\"","The Kerala school of astronomy and mathematics\nwas founded by Madhava of Sangamagrama in Kerala, which included among its members: Parameshvara\n, Neelakanta Somayaji\n, Jyeshtadeva\n, Achyuta Pisharati\n, Melpathur Narayana Bhattathiri\nand Achyuta Panikkar\n. The school flourished between the 14th and 16th centuries and the original discoveries of the school seems to have ended with Narayana Bhattathiri\n(1559–1632). In attempting to solve astronomical problems, the Kerala school independently created a number of important mathematics concepts. Their most important results—series expansion for trigonometric functions—were described in Sanskrit verse in a book by Neelakanta\ncalled Tantrasangraha\n\n, and again in a commentary on this work, called Tantrasangraha-vakhya\n, of unknown authorship. The theorems were stated without proof, but proofs for the series for sine, cosine, and inverse tangent were provided a century later in the work Yuktibha?a\n(c.1500-1610), written in Malayalam, by Jyesthadeva\n, and also in a commentary on Tantrasangraha\n.","Their work, completed two centuries before the invention of calculus in Europe\n, provided what is now considered the first example of a power series (apart from geometric series). However, they did not formulate a systematic theory of differentiation and integration, nor is there any direct evidence of their results being transmitted outside Kerala.","","","Schools and colleges are mostly run by the government, private trusts, or individuals. Each school is affiliated with either the Indian Certificate of Secondary Education\n(ICSE), the Central Board for Secondary Education\n(CBSE), Kerala State Education Board\nor the (NIOS). English is the language of instruction in most private schools, while government run schools offer English or Malayalam as the medium of instruction. Government run schools in the districts bordering Karnataka and Tamil Nadu also offer instruction in Kannada or Tamil languages. A handful of Government Sanskrit Schools provide instruction in Sanskrit supplemented by Malayalam, English, Tamil or Kannada. After 10 years of secondary schooling, students typically enroll at Higher Secondary School\nin one of the three streams—liberal arts\n, commerce\nor science\n. Upon completing the required coursework, students can enroll in general or professional degree programmes. Kerala topped the Education Development Index (EDI) among 21 major states in India in year 2006-2007.[6]\n\nIn January 2016, Kerala became the 1st Indian state to achieve 100% primary education through its literacy programme Athulyam.[7]\n\n","In spite of the large number of educational institutions in the state, the quality of education at all levels in Kerala has been showing a decline due to financial constraints resulting from quantitative expansion of the sector.[8]\n\n","A study published in 1999 by the Centre for Socio-economic \u0026amp; Environmental Studies states that while the dropout rates are very low in primary schools, the same increases in the ninth and the tenth standards in Kerala. This is particularly true of SC/ST students. Schools showed that only 73% of the students joining at 1st Standard reach the 10th Standard. In the case of scheduled caste students, only 59% reach the 10th standard. 60% of Scheduled Tribe students drop out by the 10th standard.[9]\n\n","Another major indicator of the inefficiency of Kerala's school education system is the large-scale failure of the students in the matriculation examination. Only about 50% of the students who appear for the examination get through. The percentage has been considerably increased because of major interventions by the government in the areas of curriculum and teacher training. In March 2011, 91.37% students qualified for higher studies in the matriculation Examination.The grades in SSLC examination plays an important role in the admission procedure to colleges in Kerala. [10]\n\n","The schools and colleges in Kerala are run by the government or private trusts and individuals. Each school is affiliated with either the Indian Certificate of Secondary Education\n(ICSE), the Central Board for Secondary Education\n(CBSE), Kerala State Education Board\nor the National Institute of Open Schooling\n(NIOS).

Later the industry shifted to Chennai\n(formerly Madras), which then was the capital of the South Indian film industry. By the late 1980s, the Malayalam film industry returned and established itself in Kerala[14]\n\nwith the majority of locations, studios, production and post-production facilities being located in Kochi\nand Trivandrum\n. Several media sources[15]\n\n[16]\n\n[17]\n\ndescribe Kochi\nas the hub of the film industry, while some other media sources[18]\n\nstate Trivandrum\nas the center.","","","Active Malayalam film production did not take place until the second half of the 20th century: there were only two silent films, and three Malayalam-language films before 1947.[19]\n\n[20]\n\nWith support from the Kerala state government production climbed from around 6 a year in the 1950s, to 30 a year in the 1960s, 40 a year in the 1970s, to 127 films in 1980.[19]\n\n","The first cinema hall in Kerala, with a manually operated film projector, was opened in Thrissur\nby Jose Kattookkaran\nin 1907. In 1913, the first permanent theatre in Kerala was established in Thrissur\ntown by Kattookkaran and was called the Jose Electrical Bioscope\n, now Jos Theatre\n.[21]\n\n[22]\n\n[23]\n\n","The first film made in Malayalam was Vigathakumaran\n\n. Production started in 1928, and it was released in Trivandrum Capitol Theatre on 23 October 1930. It was produced and directed by J. C. Daniel\n, a businessman with no prior film experience, who is credited as the father of Malayalam cinema.[24]\n\nDaniel founded the first film studio, The Travancore National Pictures Limited, in Kerala.[24]\n\nA second film, Marthanda Varma\n\n, based on a novel by C. V. Raman Pillai\n, was produced by R. Sundar Raj in 1933. However, after only being shown for four days, the film prints were confiscated due to a legal battle over copyright.[24]\n\n","The first talkie\nin Malayalam was Balan\n\n,[25]\n\nreleased in 1938. It was directed by S. Nottani\nwith a screenplay and songs written by Muthukulam Raghavan Pillai\n. It was produced at Chennai\n(then Madras) in the neighbouring state of Tamil Nadu\n. Balan\nwas followed by Gnanambika\nin 1940, which was directed by S. Notani. Then came Prahlada\nin 1941, directed by K. Subramoniam of Madras and featuring Guru Gopinath and Thankamani Gopinath.","Until 1947 Malayalam films were made by Tamil producers. Artist P. J. Cherian[26]\n\nwas the first Malayali producer to venture into this field and the trend then changed. He produced Nirmala\nin 1948 with Joseph Cherian and Baby Joseph his son and daughter-in-law in the lead roles as hero and heroine.

Thus Nirmala\nbecame the first film produced by a Malayali, setting many firsts for introducing play-back singing, cinema with a social theme where the entire family could sit together and watch it. Artist P.J. Cherian was the first cinema producer to explore the possibility of music and songs in cinema, and thus became the pioneer to introduce play-back singing in cinema. The lyrics of the film penned by the legendary Malayalam poet G. Sankara Kurup\nbecame so popular that song-dance sequences became essential ingredients of Malayalam cinema.","Vellinakshatram\n(1949) was the first movie to be made in Kerala and it took shape at the Udaya Studios at Alleppey.","Malayalam cinema has always taken its themes from relevant social issues and has been interwoven with material from literature\n, drama\n, and politics\nsince its inception.

The poets Tirunainaarkurichy Madhavan Nair - Thirunaiyarkurichy, P. Bhaskaran\n, O.N.V. Kurup\n, and V.R. Varma rose up in this period as film lyricists. Brother Lakshmanan, Dakshinamurthy\n, K. Raghavan\n, G. Devarajan\n, M.S. Baburaj\n, and Pukhenthey Velappan Nair started a distinct style of Malayalam music. Kamukara Purushotaman, Mehboob, Kozhikode Abdul Kader\n, AM Raja\n, P.B.

The growth of the film society movement in Kerala introduced the works of the French and Italian New Wave directors to the discerning Malayali film enthusiasts. Adoor Gopalakrishnan\n's first film, Swayamvaram\n\n(1972), brought Malayalam cinema to the international film arena. In 1973 M. T.

New Wave is characterised by fresh and unusual themes and new narrative techniques.[32]\n\n[34]\n\nThese films differ from conventional themes of the past two decades (1990s and 2000s) and have introduced several new trends to the Malayalam industry.[35]\n\nWhile the new generation's formats and styles are deeply influenced by global and Indian trends, their themes are firmly rooted in Malayali life and mindscapes.[36]\n\nThe new generation also helped the Malayalam film industry regain its past glory.[37]\n\n\nSalim Ahamed\n's Adaminte Makan Abu\n\nwas chosen as India's official entry to the Academy Awards\nto be considered for nomination in the Best Foreign Film category in 2011.\nChristian Brothers\n\n(2011) was released worldwide with a total of 310 prints on 18 March; it went to 154 centres in Kerala, 90 centres outside Kerala and 80 centres overseas, making it the widest release for a Malayalam film at that time.

C. Daniel\n, the director and producer\nof the first Malayalam film, Vigathakumaran\n\n(1928). Unlike other Indian films at that time, most of which were based on the puranas\n, he chose to base his film on a social theme.[47]\n\nThough it failed commercially, he paved the way for the Malayalam film industry and is widely considered the \"father of Malayalam cinema\". Until the 1950s, Malayalam film didn't see many talented film directors. The milestone film Neelakkuyil\n\n(1954), directed by Ramu Karyat\nand P. Bhaskaran\n, shed a lot of limelight over its directors.[40]\n\nRamu Karyat\nwent on to become a celebrated director in the 1960s and 1970s. P. Bhaskaran\ndirected a few acclaimed films in the 1960s. The cameraman of Neelakkuyil\n\n, A. Vincent\n, also became a noted director of the 1960s and 1970s.[48]\n\nAnother noted director of the 1950s was P. Ramadas, the director of the neorealistic film Newspaper Boy\n\n(1955).\nIn the 1970s, the Malayalam film industry saw the rise of film societies. It triggered a new genre of films\nknown as \"parallel cinema\". The main driving forces of the movement, who gave priority to serious cinema, were Adoor Gopalakrishnan\nand G. Aravindan\n. People like John Abraham\nand P. A. Backer\ngave a new dimension to Malayalam cinema through their political themes. The late 1970s witnessed the emergence of another stream of Malayalam films, known as \"middle-stream cinema\", which seamlessly integrated the seriousness of the parallel cinema and the popularity of the mainstream cinema. Most of the films belonging to this stream were directed by PN Menon, I. V. Sasi\n, P. G. Viswambharan\n, K. G. George\n, Bharathan and Padmarajan\n.[49]\n\n\nIn the 1980s and early 1990s, a new array of directors joined the stalwarts who had already made a mark in the industry. This period saw the narrowing of the gap between the different streams of the industry.[40]\n\nDirectors like K. G. George\n, Priyadarshan\n, I. V. Sasi\n, John Abraham\n, Fazil\n, Joshy\n, Bhadran\n, P. G. Viswambharan\n, Kamal\n, Sibi Malayil\n, Hariharan\n, Sathyan Anthikkad\n, K. Madhu\nand Siddique-Lal\ncontributed significantly . There were also extraordinary screenwriters like M. T. Vasudevan Nair\n, T. Damodaran\n, A. K. Lohithadas\nand Sreenivasan\n, whose contributions were also commendable.[citation needed\n\n\n]\n\nThe 2000s saw a decline in the quality of Malayalam films. Many directors who had excelled in the Golden Age struggled as many of their films continuously failed critically and commercially. As a result, the gap between parallel cinema (now known as art cinema) and mainstream cinema (now known as commercial cinema) widened. The 2000s also saw a commercial film formula being created in line with Tamil\nand Bollywood\nfilms. Directors like Shaji Kailas\n, Rafi Mecartin\nand Anwar Rasheed\ndirected blockbusters which had few artistic merits to boast of. Despite the overall decline, some directors stood apart and made quality cinema. Shaji N. Karun\n, Lenin Rajendran\n, Shyama Prasad\nand Jayaraj\nmade films that won laurels. Notable directors who debuted in this time include Blessy\n, Lal Jose\n, R. Sharath, Ranjith\n, Roshan Andrews\n, Amal Neerad\n, Aashiq Abu\n, Vineeth Sreenivasan\nand Lijo Jose Pellissery\n.[citation needed\n\n\n]\n\nOut of the 40 National Film Awards for Best Director\ngiven away till 2007, Malayalam directors have received 12. The directors who have won include Adoor Gopalakrishnan\n(1973, 1985, 1988, 1990, 2007), G. Aravindan\n(1978, 1979, 1987), Shaji N. Karun\n(1989), T. V. Chandran\n(1994), Jayaraj\n(1998) and Rajivnath (1999). There are several recipients of the Special Jury Award\nas well: Mankada Ravi Varma\n(1984), John Abraham\n(1987), Shaji N. Karun\n(1995) and Pradeep Nair (2005).[50]\n\n[51]\n\n\nFilm music\n[\nedit\n]\n\n\nFilm music\n, which refers to playback singing\nin the context of Indian music\n, forms the most important canon of popular music\nin India. The film music of Kerala in particular is the most popular form of music in the state.[52]\n\nBefore Malayalam cinema and Malayalam film music developed, the Keralites\neagerly followed Tamil\nand Hindi\nfilm songs, and that habit has stayed with them until now. The history of Malayalam film songs begins with the 1948 film Nirmala\nwhich was produced by artist P.J. Cherian who introduced play-back singing for the first time in the film. The film's music composer was P. S. Divakar, and the songs were sung by P. Leela\n, T. K. Govinda Rao, Vasudeva Kurup, C. K. Raghavan, Sarojini Menon and Vimala B. Varma, who is credited as the first playback singer of Malayalam cinema.[53]\n\n\nThe main trend in the early years was to use the tune of hit Hindi or Tamil songs in Malayalam songs. This trend changed in the early 1950s with the arrival of a number of poets and musicians to the Malayalam music scene. By the middle of 1950s, the Malayalam film music industry started finding its own identity. This reformation was led by the music directors Brother Laxmanan, G. Devarajan\n, V. Dakshinamurthy\n, M.S. Babu Raj\nand K. Raghavan\nalong with the lyricists Vayalar Rama Varma\n, P. Bhaskaran\n, O. N. V. Kurup\nand Sreekumaran Thampi\n.[54]\n\nMajor playback singers of that time were Kamukara Purushothaman\n, K. P. Udayabhanu\n, A. M. Raja\n, P. Leela, Santha P. Nair, P. Susheela\n, P. Madhuri\nand S. Janaki\n. Despite that, these singers got high popularity throughout Kerala and were part of the Golden age of Malayalam music (1960 to 1970). In the later years many non-Malayalis like Manna Dey\n, Talat Mahmood\n, Lata Mangeshkar\n, Asha Bhosle\n, Hemalata and S. P. Balasubrahmanyam\nsang for Malayalam films. This trend was also found among composers\nto an extent, with film composers from other languages including Naushad Ali\n, Usha Khanna\n, M. B. Sreenivasan\n, Bombay Ravi\n, Shyam\n, Bappi Lahiri\n, Laxmikant-Pyarelal\n, Salil Chowdhury\n, Ilaiyaraaja\n, Vishal Bhardwaj\nand A. R. Rahman\nscoring music for Malayalam films.[54]\n\nThis can be attributed to the fact that film music in South India\nhad a parallel growth pattern with many instances of cross-industry contributions.[citation needed\n\n\n]\n. The late 1950s through mid-1970s can be considered as the golden period of Malayalam film music in its own identity. Along with the leading music directors, the likes of M. B. Sreenivasan\n, M. K. Arjunan\n, Pukezhenty Vellappan Nair, M. S. Viswanathan\n, A. T. Ummer\n, R. K. Shekhar\n, Salil Choudhury\nand lyricists like Thirunainar Kurichi Madhavan Nair\n, Mankombu Gopalakrishnan\nand Bharanikkavu Sivakumar, numerous everlasting and super hit songs were delivered to the music lovers. The soft melodious music and high quality lyrics were the highlights of these songs.\nK. J. Yesudas\n, who debuted in 1961, virtually revolutionised the Malayalam film music industry and became the most popular Malayalam singer ever along with K.S. Chitra. The trio of Vayalar\n, G. Devarajan\nand Yesudas\nalso made unforgettable songs like the earlier trio of Kamukara, Tirunainaarkurichy and Brother Laxmanan. Yesudas became equally popular with classical music audience and people who patronised film music.[55]\n\nHe along with P. Jayachandran\ngave a major face-lift to Malayalam playback singing in the 1960s and 1970s. K. S. Chithra\ndebuted in 1979, and by the mid-eighties, she became the most sought after female singer in South India\n.\nBy the late 1970s, the trends in music started changing and more rhythm oriented songs with a western touch came with the dominance of music directors like Shyam\n, K. J. Joy, and Jerry Amaldev\n. The lyricists were forced to write lyrics according to the tune in these days and were often criticized for quality issues. However, from 1979 to 1980, the revolutionary music director Raveendran\nalong with Johnson\nand M. G. Radhakrishnan\nled the second reformation of Malayalam film music by creating melodious and classical oriented music with the soul of the culture of Kerala. Lyricists like Poovachal Khader\n, Kavalam Narayana Panicker\nand Bichu Thirumala\nin 1980s and Kaithapram Damodaran Namboothiri\n, Gireesh Puthenchery\nin 1990s were part of this musical success. Contributions from Kannur Rajan\n, Bombay Ravi\n, S. P. Venkatesh\n, Mohan Sithara\n, Ouseppachan\n, Sharath\n, Vidyadharan, Raghukumar and Vidyasagar\nwere also notable in this period. K. J. Yesudas\nand K. S. Chitra\nand singers like M. G. Sreekumar\n, G. Venugopal\nUnnimenon\nand Sujatha Mohan\nwere also active then. A notable aspect in the later years was the extensive of classical carnatic music\nin many film songs of the 1980s and 1990s. Classical carnatic music was heavily used in films like Chithram\n\n(1988), His Highness Abdullah\n\n(1990), Bharatham\n\n(1991), Sargam\n\n(1992) and Sopanam\n(1993).[citation needed\n\n\n]\n\nAt present, the major players in the scene are young composers like Rahul Raj\n, Prashant Pillai\n, Shaan Rahman\n, Bijibal\n, Gopi Sundar\n, Alphonse,\nRajesh Murugesan\n, lyricists Rafeeq Ahmed\n, Vayalar Sarath\nand Anil Panachooran, and singers Vineeth Sreenivasan\n, Vijay Yesudas\n, Shweta Mohan\n, Manjari\nand Jyotsna Radhakrishnan\n, along with stalwarts in the field.\nYoung composers like Rahul Raj and Prashant Pillai are not only known for their catchy tunes, but also for bringing in a lot of electronics, digital sound and a variety of genres in Malayalam film scores and songs.[56]\n\n\nThe National Award-winning music composers\nof Malayalam cinema are Johnson\n(1994, 1995), Bombay Ravi\n(1995), Ouseppachan\n(2008), Ilaiyaraaja\n(2010), Issac Thomas Kottukapally (2011),[Bijibal] (2012) and M. Jayachandran (2016). Until 2009, the 1995 National Award that Johnson received for the film score\nof Sukrutham\n(1994) was the only instance in the history of the award in which the awardee composed the film soundtrack\nrather than its songs\n. He shared that award with Bombay Ravi, who received the award for composing songs for the same film. In 2010 and 2011, the awards given to film scores were won by Malayalam films: Pazhassi Raja\n(2010; score: Ilaiyaraaja) and Adaminte Makan Abu\n(2011; score: Issak Thomas Kottakapally). Ravindran\nalso received a Special Jury Award\nin 1992 for composing songs for the film Bharatham\n\n. The lyricists who have won the National Award\nare Vayalar Ramavarma\n(1973), O. N. V.

In 2001 came the world's first film with only one actor in the cast, The Guard\n. Slapstick comedy was the predominant theme of the films of this era. C.I.D. Moosa\n\n(2003) by Johny Antony\n, Meesa Madhavan\n\n(2002) by Lal Jose\nand Kunjikoonan\n\n(2002) directed by Sasi Shanker\nare examples. Sequels to a number of successful films were made. Some movies were examples of exemplary film making, such as Meghamalhar\n\n, Madhuranombarakaattu\n\n, Nandanam\n\n, Perumazhakkalam\n\n, and Kazhcha\n\n. In 2008, Malayalam movie artists came together in the multistar film Twenty:20\n\nto raise funds for the AMMA.[31]\n\n","After several years of quality deterioration, Malayalam films saw the signs of massive resurgence after 2010[32]\n\nwith the release of several experimental films (known as New Wave\nor New Generation films),[33]\n\nmostly from new directors. New Wave is characterised by fresh and unusual themes and new narrative techniques.[32]\n\n[34]\n\nThese films differ from conventional themes of the past two decades (1990s and 2000s) and have introduced several new trends to the Malayalam industry.[35]\n\nWhile the new generation's formats and styles are deeply influenced by global and Indian trends, their themes are firmly rooted in Malayali life and mindscapes.[36]\n\nThe new generation also helped the Malayalam film industry regain its past glory.[37]\n\n","Salim Ahamed\n's Adaminte Makan Abu\n\nwas chosen as India's official entry to the Academy Awards\nto be considered for nomination in the Best Foreign Film category in 2011.","Christian Brothers\n\n(2011) was released worldwide with a total of 310 prints on 18 March; it went to 154 centres in Kerala, 90 centres outside Kerala and 80 centres overseas, making it the widest release for a Malayalam film at that time. This record was later broken by Peruchazhi\n\n(2014), which released in 500 screens worldwide on 29 August.[38]\n\nDrishyam\n\n(2013) became the first Malayalam film to cross the 50 crores mark at the box office. The film was critically acclaimed and was remade in four languages.[39]\n\nLater, in 2016, Pulimurugan\n\nbecame the first Malayalam film to cross the 100 crores mark at the box office.","Newspaper Boy\n\n(1955), a neorealistic\nfilm, drew inspiration from Italian neorealism\n.[13]\n\n[40]\n\nPadayottam\n\n(1982) was India's first indigenously produced 70 mm film\n,[41]\n\nwhile My Dear Kuttichathan\n\n(1984) was India's first 3D film.[12]\n\nIndia's first live-action\n/animation\nhybrid film.[42]\n\n\nAmma Ariyan\n\n(1986) was the first film made in India with money collected from the public. It was produced by Odessa Collective, founded by the director John Abraham\nand friends. The money was raised by collecting donations and screening Charlie Chaplin\n's film The Kid\n\n.[43]\n\n\nMoonnamathoral\n\n(2006) was the first Indian film to be shot and distributed in digital format\n.[44]\n\n\nJalachhayam\n\n(2010) was the world first feature film shot entirely on a cell phone\ncamera[45]\n\nand it was also an experimental\nfilm directed by Sathish Kalathil\nwho is the director of Veena Vaadanam\n, the first documentary film in India shot with the same movie capture medium.\nVillain\n\n(2017) is the first Indian film to be shot entirely in 8K resolution\n.[46]\n\n\nNotable personalities\n[\nedit\n]\n\n\nDirectors\n[\nedit\n]\n\n\nMalayalam cinema's directors have included J. C. Daniel\n, the director and producer\nof the first Malayalam film, Vigathakumaran\n\n(1928). Unlike other Indian films at that time, most of which were based on the puranas\n, he chose to base his film on a social theme.[47]\n\nThough it failed commercially, he paved the way for the Malayalam film industry and is widely considered the \"father of Malayalam cinema\". Until the 1950s, Malayalam film didn't see many talented film directors. The milestone film Neelakkuyil\n\n(1954), directed by Ramu Karyat\nand P. Bhaskaran\n, shed a lot of limelight over its directors.[40]\n\nRamu Karyat\nwent on to become a celebrated director in the 1960s and 1970s. P. Bhaskaran\ndirected a few acclaimed films in the 1960s. The cameraman of Neelakkuyil\n\n, A. Vincent\n, also became a noted director of the 1960s and 1970s.[48]\n\nAnother noted director of the 1950s was P. Ramadas, the director of the neorealistic film Newspaper Boy\n\n(1955).\nIn the 1970s, the Malayalam film industry saw the rise of film societies. It triggered a new genre of films\nknown as \"parallel cinema\". The main driving forces of the movement, who gave priority to serious cinema, were Adoor Gopalakrishnan\nand G. Aravindan\n. People like John Abraham\nand P. A. Backer\ngave a new dimension to Malayalam cinema through their political themes. The late 1970s witnessed the emergence of another stream of Malayalam films, known as \"middle-stream cinema\", which seamlessly integrated the seriousness of the parallel cinema and the popularity of the mainstream cinema. Most of the films belonging to this stream were directed by PN Menon, I. V. Sasi\n, P. G. Viswambharan\n, K. G. George\n, Bharathan and Padmarajan\n.[49]\n\n\nIn the 1980s and early 1990s, a new array of directors joined the stalwarts who had already made a mark in the industry. This period saw the narrowing of the gap between the different streams of the industry.[40]\n\nDirectors like K. G. George\n, Priyadarshan\n, I. V. Sasi\n, John Abraham\n, Fazil\n, Joshy\n, Bhadran\n, P. G. Viswambharan\n, Kamal\n, Sibi Malayil\n, Hariharan\n, Sathyan Anthikkad\n, K. Madhu\nand Siddique-Lal\ncontributed significantly . There were also extraordinary screenwriters like M. T. Vasudevan Nair\n, T. Damodaran\n, A. K. Lohithadas\nand Sreenivasan\n, whose contributions were also commendable.[citation needed\n\n\n]\n\nThe 2000s saw a decline in the quality of Malayalam films. Many directors who had excelled in the Golden Age struggled as many of their films continuously failed critically and commercially. As a result, the gap between parallel cinema (now known as art cinema) and mainstream cinema (now known as commercial cinema) widened. The 2000s also saw a commercial film formula being created in line with Tamil\nand Bollywood\nfilms. Directors like Shaji Kailas\n, Rafi Mecartin\nand Anwar Rasheed\ndirected blockbusters which had few artistic merits to boast of. Despite the overall decline, some directors stood apart and made quality cinema. Shaji N. Karun\n, Lenin Rajendran\n, Shyama Prasad\nand Jayaraj\nmade films that won laurels. Notable directors who debuted in this time include Blessy\n, Lal Jose\n, R. Sharath, Ranjith\n, Roshan Andrews\n, Amal Neerad\n, Aashiq Abu\n, Vineeth Sreenivasan\nand Lijo Jose Pellissery\n.[citation needed\n\n\n]\n\nOut of the 40 National Film Awards for Best Director\ngiven away till 2007, Malayalam directors have received 12. The directors who have won include Adoor Gopalakrishnan\n(1973, 1985, 1988, 1990, 2007), G. Aravindan\n(1978, 1979, 1987), Shaji N. Karun\n(1989), T. V. Chandran\n(1994), Jayaraj\n(1998) and Rajivnath (1999). There are several recipients of the Special Jury Award\nas well: Mankada Ravi Varma\n(1984), John Abraham\n(1987), Shaji N. Karun\n(1995) and Pradeep Nair (2005).[50]\n\n[51]\n\n\nFilm music\n[\nedit\n]\n\n\nFilm music\n, which refers to playback singing\nin the context of Indian music\n, forms the most important canon of popular music\nin India. The film music of Kerala in particular is the most popular form of music in the state.[52]\n\nBefore Malayalam cinema and Malayalam film music developed, the Keralites\neagerly followed Tamil\nand Hindi\nfilm songs, and that habit has stayed with them until now. The history of Malayalam film songs begins with the 1948 film Nirmala\nwhich was produced by artist P.J. Cherian who introduced play-back singing for the first time in the film. The film's music composer was P. S. Divakar, and the songs were sung by P. Leela\n, T. K. Govinda Rao, Vasudeva Kurup, C. K. Raghavan, Sarojini Menon and Vimala B. Varma, who is credited as the first playback singer of Malayalam cinema.[53]\n\n\nThe main trend in the early years was to use the tune of hit Hindi or Tamil songs in Malayalam songs. This trend changed in the early 1950s with the arrival of a number of poets and musicians to the Malayalam music scene. By the middle of 1950s, the Malayalam film music industry started finding its own identity. This reformation was led by the music directors Brother Laxmanan, G. Devarajan\n, V. Dakshinamurthy\n, M.S. Babu Raj\nand K. Raghavan\nalong with the lyricists Vayalar Rama Varma\n, P. Bhaskaran\n, O. N. V. Kurup\nand Sreekumaran Thampi\n.[54]\n\nMajor playback singers of that time were Kamukara Purushothaman\n, K. P. Udayabhanu\n, A. M. Raja\n, P. Leela, Santha P. Nair, P. Susheela\n, P. Madhuri\nand S. Janaki\n. Despite that, these singers got high popularity throughout Kerala and were part of the Golden age of Malayalam music (1960 to 1970). In the later years many non-Malayalis like Manna Dey\n, Talat Mahmood\n, Lata Mangeshkar\n, Asha Bhosle\n, Hemalata and S. P. Balasubrahmanyam\nsang for Malayalam films. This trend was also found among composers\nto an extent, with film composers from other languages including Naushad Ali\n, Usha Khanna\n, M. B. Sreenivasan\n, Bombay Ravi\n, Shyam\n, Bappi Lahiri\n, Laxmikant-Pyarelal\n, Salil Chowdhury\n, Ilaiyaraaja\n, Vishal Bhardwaj\nand A. R. Rahman\nscoring music for Malayalam films.[54]\n\nThis can be attributed to the fact that film music in South India\nhad a parallel growth pattern with many instances of cross-industry contributions.[citation needed\n\n\n]\n. The late 1950s through mid-1970s can be considered as the golden period of Malayalam film music in its own identity. Along with the leading music directors, the likes of M. B. Sreenivasan\n, M. K. Arjunan\n, Pukezhenty Vellappan Nair, M. S. Viswanathan\n, A. T. Ummer\n, R. K. Shekhar\n, Salil Choudhury\nand lyricists like Thirunainar Kurichi Madhavan Nair\n, Mankombu Gopalakrishnan\nand Bharanikkavu Sivakumar, numerous everlasting and super hit songs were delivered to the music lovers. The soft melodious music and high quality lyrics were the highlights of these songs.\nK. J. Yesudas\n, who debuted in 1961, virtually revolutionised the Malayalam film music industry and became the most popular Malayalam singer ever along with K.S. Chitra. The trio of Vayalar\n, G. Devarajan\nand Yesudas\nalso made unforgettable songs like the earlier trio of Kamukara, Tirunainaarkurichy and Brother Laxmanan. Yesudas became equally popular with classical music audience and people who patronised film music.[55]\n\nHe along with P. Jayachandran\ngave a major face-lift to Malayalam playback singing in the 1960s and 1970s. K. S. Chithra\ndebuted in 1979, and by the mid-eighties, she became the most sought after female singer in South India\n.\nBy the late 1970s, the trends in music started changing and more rhythm oriented songs with a western touch came with the dominance of music directors like Shyam\n, K. J. Joy, and Jerry Amaldev\n. The lyricists were forced to write lyrics according to the tune in these days and were often criticized for quality issues. However, from 1979 to 1980, the revolutionary music director Raveendran\nalong with Johnson\nand M. G. Radhakrishnan\nled the second reformation of Malayalam film music by creating melodious and classical oriented music with the soul of the culture of Kerala. Lyricists like Poovachal Khader\n, Kavalam Narayana Panicker\nand Bichu Thirumala\nin 1980s and Kaithapram Damodaran Namboothiri\n, Gireesh Puthenchery\nin 1990s were part of this musical success. Contributions from Kannur Rajan\n, Bombay Ravi\n, S. P. Venkatesh\n, Mohan Sithara\n, Ouseppachan\n, Sharath\n, Vidyadharan, Raghukumar and Vidyasagar\nwere also notable in this period. K. J. Yesudas\nand K. S. Chitra\nand singers like M. G. Sreekumar\n, G. Venugopal\nUnnimenon\nand Sujatha Mohan\nwere also active then. A notable aspect in the later years was the extensive of classical carnatic music\nin many film songs of the 1980s and 1990s. Classical carnatic music was heavily used in films like Chithram\n\n(1988), His Highness Abdullah\n\n(1990), Bharatham\n\n(1991), Sargam\n\n(1992) and Sopanam\n(1993).[citation needed\n\n\n]\n\nAt present, the major players in the scene are young composers like Rahul Raj\n, Prashant Pillai\n, Shaan Rahman\n, Bijibal\n, Gopi Sundar\n, Alphonse,\nRajesh Murugesan\n, lyricists Rafeeq Ahmed\n, Vayalar Sarath\nand Anil Panachooran, and singers Vineeth Sreenivasan\n, Vijay Yesudas\n, Shweta Mohan\n, Manjari\nand Jyotsna Radhakrishnan\n, along with stalwarts in the field.\nYoung composers like Rahul Raj and Prashant Pillai are not only known for their catchy tunes, but also for bringing in a lot of electronics, digital sound and a variety of genres in Malayalam film scores and songs.[56]\n\n\nThe National Award-winning music composers\nof Malayalam cinema are Johnson\n(1994, 1995), Bombay Ravi\n(1995), Ouseppachan\n(2008), Ilaiyaraaja\n(2010), Issac Thomas Kottukapally (2011),[Bijibal] (2012) and M. Jayachandran (2016). Until 2009, the 1995 National Award that Johnson received for the film score\nof Sukrutham\n(1994) was the only instance in the history of the award in which the awardee composed the film soundtrack\nrather than its songs\n. He shared that award with Bombay Ravi, who received the award for composing songs for the same film. In 2010 and 2011, the awards given to film scores were won by Malayalam films: Pazhassi Raja\n(2010; score: Ilaiyaraaja) and Adaminte Makan Abu\n(2011; score: Issak Thomas Kottakapally). Ravindran\nalso received a Special Jury Award\nin 1992 for composing songs for the film Bharatham\n\n. The lyricists who have won the National Award\nare Vayalar Ramavarma\n(1973), O. N. V. Kurup\n(1989) and Yusuf Ali Kechery\n(2001). The male singers who have received the National Award\nare K. J. Yesudas\n(1973, 1974, 1988, 1992, 1994), P. Jayachandran\n(1986) and M. G. Sreekumar\n(1991, 2000). Yesudas has won two more National Awards for singing in Hindi\n(1977) and Telugu\n(1983) films, which makes him the person who has won the most National Film Awards for Best Male Playback Singer, with seven. The female singers who have won the award\nare S. Janaki\n(1981) and K. S. Chithra\n(1987, 1989). Chitra had also won the award for Tamil (1986, 1997, 2005) and Hindi (1998) film songs, which makes her the person with the most National Film Awards for Best Female Playback Singer, with six.[citation needed\n\n\n]\n\nLandmark films\n[\nedit\n]\n\n\nYear\nTitle\nDirector\nNotes\nRef.\n\n\n1928\nVigathakumaran\n\n\nJ.

C. Daniel\n, the director and producer\nof the first Malayalam film, Vigathakumaran\n\n(1928). Unlike other Indian films at that time, most of which were based on the puranas\n, he chose to base his film on a social theme.[47]\n\nThough it failed commercially, he paved the way for the Malayalam film industry and is widely considered the \"father of Malayalam cinema\". Until the 1950s, Malayalam film didn't see many talented film directors. The milestone film Neelakkuyil\n\n(1954), directed by Ramu Karyat\nand P. Bhaskaran\n, shed a lot of limelight over its directors.[40]\n\nRamu Karyat\nwent on to become a celebrated director in the 1960s and 1970s. P. Bhaskaran\ndirected a few acclaimed films in the 1960s. The cameraman of Neelakkuyil\n\n, A. Vincent\n, also became a noted director of the 1960s and 1970s.[48]\n\nAnother noted director of the 1950s was P. Ramadas, the director of the neorealistic film Newspaper Boy\n\n(1955).","In the 1970s, the Malayalam film industry saw the rise of film societies. It triggered a new genre of films\nknown as \"parallel cinema\". The main driving forces of the movement, who gave priority to serious cinema, were Adoor Gopalakrishnan\nand G. Aravindan\n. People like John Abraham\nand P. A. Backer\ngave a new dimension to Malayalam cinema through their political themes. The late 1970s witnessed the emergence of another stream of Malayalam films, known as \"middle-stream cinema\", which seamlessly integrated the seriousness of the parallel cinema and the popularity of the mainstream cinema. Most of the films belonging to this stream were directed by PN Menon, I. V. Sasi\n, P. G. Viswambharan\n, K. G. George\n, Bharathan and Padmarajan\n.[49]\n\n","In the 1980s and early 1990s, a new array of directors joined the stalwarts who had already made a mark in the industry. This period saw the narrowing of the gap between the different streams of the industry.[40]\n\nDirectors like K. G. George\n, Priyadarshan\n, I. V.

There were also extraordinary screenwriters like M. T. Vasudevan Nair\n, T. Damodaran\n, A. K. Lohithadas\nand Sreenivasan\n, whose contributions were also commendable.[citation needed\n\n\n]\n","The 2000s saw a decline in the quality of Malayalam films. Many directors who had excelled in the Golden Age struggled as many of their films continuously failed critically and commercially. As a result, the gap between parallel cinema (now known as art cinema) and mainstream cinema (now known as commercial cinema) widened. The 2000s also saw a commercial film formula being created in line with Tamil\nand Bollywood\nfilms. Directors like Shaji Kailas\n, Rafi Mecartin\nand Anwar Rasheed\ndirected blockbusters which had few artistic merits to boast of. Despite the overall decline, some directors stood apart and made quality cinema. Shaji N. Karun\n, Lenin Rajendran\n, Shyama Prasad\nand Jayaraj\nmade films that won laurels. Notable directors who debuted in this time include Blessy\n, Lal Jose\n, R. Sharath, Ranjith\n, Roshan Andrews\n, Amal Neerad\n, Aashiq Abu\n, Vineeth Sreenivasan\nand Lijo Jose Pellissery\n.[citation needed\n\n\n]\n","Out of the 40 National Film Awards for Best Director\ngiven away till 2007, Malayalam directors have received 12.

The film music of Kerala in particular is the most popular form of music in the state.[52]\n\nBefore Malayalam cinema and Malayalam film music developed, the Keralites\neagerly followed Tamil\nand Hindi\nfilm songs, and that habit has stayed with them until now. The history of Malayalam film songs begins with the 1948 film Nirmala\nwhich was produced by artist P.J. Cherian who introduced play-back singing for the first time in the film. The film's music composer was P. S. Divakar, and the songs were sung by P. Leela\n, T. K. Govinda Rao, Vasudeva Kurup, C. K. Raghavan, Sarojini Menon and Vimala B. Varma, who is credited as the first playback singer of Malayalam cinema.[53]\n\n","The main trend in the early years was to use the tune of hit Hindi or Tamil songs in Malayalam songs. This trend changed in the early 1950s with the arrival of a number of poets and musicians to the Malayalam music scene. By the middle of 1950s, the Malayalam film music industry started finding its own identity. This reformation was led by the music directors Brother Laxmanan, G. Devarajan\n, V. Dakshinamurthy\n, M.S. Babu Raj\nand K. Raghavan\nalong with the lyricists Vayalar Rama Varma\n, P. Bhaskaran\n, O. N. V. Kurup\nand Sreekumaran Thampi\n.[54]\n\nMajor playback singers of that time were Kamukara Purushothaman\n, K. P. Udayabhanu\n, A. M. Raja\n, P. Leela, Santha P. Nair, P. Susheela\n, P. Madhuri\nand S. Janaki\n. Despite that, these singers got high popularity throughout Kerala and were part of the Golden age of Malayalam music (1960 to 1970). In the later years many non-Malayalis like Manna Dey\n, Talat Mahmood\n, Lata Mangeshkar\n, Asha Bhosle\n, Hemalata and S. P. Balasubrahmanyam\nsang for Malayalam films. This trend was also found among composers\nto an extent, with film composers from other languages including Naushad Ali\n, Usha Khanna\n, M. B. Sreenivasan\n, Bombay Ravi\n, Shyam\n, Bappi Lahiri\n, Laxmikant-Pyarelal\n, Salil Chowdhury\n, Ilaiyaraaja\n, Vishal Bhardwaj\nand A. R. Rahman\nscoring music for Malayalam films.[54]\n\nThis can be attributed to the fact that film music in South India\nhad a parallel growth pattern with many instances of cross-industry contributions.[citation needed\n\n\n]\n. The late 1950s through mid-1970s can be considered as the golden period of Malayalam film music in its own identity. Along with the leading music directors, the likes of M. B. Sreenivasan\n, M. K. Arjunan\n, Pukezhenty Vellappan Nair, M. S. Viswanathan\n, A. T. Ummer\n, R. K. Shekhar\n, Salil Choudhury\nand lyricists like Thirunainar Kurichi Madhavan Nair\n, Mankombu Gopalakrishnan\nand Bharanikkavu Sivakumar, numerous everlasting and super hit songs were delivered to the music lovers. The soft melodious music and high quality lyrics were the highlights of these songs.","K. J. Yesudas\n, who debuted in 1961, virtually revolutionised the Malayalam film music industry and became the most popular Malayalam singer ever along with K.S. Chitra. The trio of Vayalar\n, G. Devarajan\nand Yesudas\nalso made unforgettable songs like the earlier trio of Kamukara, Tirunainaarkurichy and Brother Laxmanan. Yesudas became equally popular with classical music audience and people who patronised film music.[55]\n\nHe along with P. Jayachandran\ngave a major face-lift to Malayalam playback singing in the 1960s and 1970s. K. S. Chithra\ndebuted in 1979, and by the mid-eighties, she became the most sought after female singer in South India\n.","By the late 1970s, the trends in music started changing and more rhythm oriented songs with a western touch came with the dominance of music directors like Shyam\n, K. J. Joy, and Jerry Amaldev\n. The lyricists were forced to write lyrics according to the tune in these days and were often criticized for quality issues. However, from 1979 to 1980, the revolutionary music director Raveendran\nalong with Johnson\nand M. G. Radhakrishnan\nled the second reformation of Malayalam film music by creating melodious and classical oriented music with the soul of the culture of Kerala. Lyricists like Poovachal Khader\n, Kavalam Narayana Panicker\nand Bichu Thirumala\nin 1980s and Kaithapram Damodaran Namboothiri\n, Gireesh Puthenchery\nin 1990s were part of this musical success. Contributions from Kannur Rajan\n, Bombay Ravi\n, S. P. Venkatesh\n, Mohan Sithara\n, Ouseppachan\n, Sharath\n, Vidyadharan, Raghukumar and Vidyasagar\nwere also notable in this period. K. J. Yesudas\nand K. S. Chitra\nand singers like M. G. Sreekumar\n, G. Venugopal\nUnnimenon\nand Sujatha Mohan\nwere also active then. A notable aspect in the later years was the extensive of classical carnatic music\nin many film songs of the 1980s and 1990s. Classical carnatic music was heavily used in films like Chithram\n\n(1988), His Highness Abdullah\n\n(1990), Bharatham\n\n(1991), Sargam\n\n(1992) and Sopanam\n(1993).[citation needed\n\n\n]\n","At present, the major players in the scene are young composers like Rahul Raj\n, Prashant Pillai\n, Shaan Rahman\n, Bijibal\n, Gopi Sundar\n, Alphonse,\nRajesh Murugesan\n, lyricists Rafeeq Ahmed\n, Vayalar Sarath\nand Anil Panachooran, and singers Vineeth Sreenivasan\n, Vijay Yesudas\n, Shweta Mohan\n, Manjari\nand Jyotsna Radhakrishnan\n, along with stalwarts in the field.","Young composers like Rahul Raj and Prashant Pillai are not only known for their catchy tunes, but also for bringing in a lot of electronics, digital sound and a variety of genres in Malayalam film scores and songs.[56]\n\n","The National Award-winning music composers\nof Malayalam cinema are Johnson\n(1994, 1995), Bombay Ravi\n(1995), Ouseppachan\n(2008), Ilaiyaraaja\n(2010), Issac Thomas Kottukapally (2011),[Bijibal] (2012) and M.

Meanwhile, its extreme eastern fringes experience a drier tropical wet and dry climate. Kerala receives an average annual rainfall of 3107\u0026#160;mm – some 7,030\u0026#160;crore\nm3\nof water. This compares to the all-India average is 1,197\u0026#160;mm. Parts of Kerala's lowlands may average only 1250\u0026#160;mm annually while the cool mountainous eastern highlands of Idukki district\n– comprising Kerala's wettest region – receive in excess of 5,000\u0026#160;mm of orographic precipitation\n(4,200\u0026#160;crore of which area available for human use) annually. Kerala's rains are mostly the result of seasonal monsoons. As a result, Kerala averages some 120–140 rainy days per year. In summer, most of Kerala is prone to gale\n-force winds, storm surges\n, and torrential downpours accompanying dangerous cyclones\ncoming in off the Indian Ocean. Kerala’s average maximum daily temperature is around 32\u0026#160;°C; the minimum is 19.8\u0026#160;°C.","Eastern Kerala consists of land encroached upon by the Western Ghats; the region thus includes high mountains, gorges, and deep-cut valleys. The wildest lands are covered with dense forests, while other regions lie under tea and coffee plantations (established mainly in the 19th and 20th centuries) or other forms of cultivation. Forty-one of Kerala’s forty-four rivers originate in this region, and the Cauvery River descends from there and drains eastwards into neighboring states. Here, the Western Ghats form a wall of mountains penetrated near Palakkad; here, a natural mountain pass\nknown as the Palakkad Gap\nbreaks through to access inner India. The Western Ghats rises on average to 1500 m elevation above sea level. Certain peaks may reach to 2500 m. Just west of the mountains lie the midland plains, comprising a swathe of land running along central Kerala. Here, rolling hills and shallow valleys fill a gentler landscape than the highlands. In the lowest lands, the midlands region hosts paddy fields\n; meanwhile, elevated lands slopes play host to groves of rubber and fruit trees in addition to other crops such as black pepper\n, tapioca\n, and others.","Finally, Kerala’s coastal belt is relatively flat, teeming with paddy fields, groves of coconut trees\n, and heavily crisscrossed by a network of interconnected canals and rivers. The comparative water-richness of the coastal belt can be partly gauged by the fact that Kuttanad\n, with its backwaters canals and rivers, itself comprises more than 20% of India's waterways by length. The most important of Kerala’s forty-four rivers\ninclude the Periyar\n(244\u0026#160;km in length), the Bharathapuzha\n(209\u0026#160;km), the Pamba River\n(176\u0026#160;km), the Chalakudy Puzha(144\u0026#160;km), the Kadalundipuzha (130\u0026#160;km), and the Achancoil (128\u0026#160;km). Most of the remainder are small and entirely fed by the Monsoons\n.","There are 44 rivers in Kerala, all but three originating in the Western Ghats\n. 41 of them flow westward and 3 eastward. The rivers of Kerala are small, in terms of length, breadth and water discharge. The rivers flow faster, owing to the hilly terrain and as the short distance between the Western Ghats and the sea. All the rivers are entirely monsoon-fed and many of them shrink into rivulets or dry up completely during summer.","The Kerala Backwaters\nregion is a particularly well-recognized feature of Kerala; it is an interconnected system of brackish\nwater lakes and river estuaries\nthat lies inland from the coast and runs virtually the length of the state. These facilitate inland travel throughout a region roughly bounded by Thiruvananthapuram in the south and Vatakara\n(which lies some 450\u0026#160;km to the north). There are 34 backwaters in Kerala Lake Vembanad—Kerala's largest body of water —dominates the backwaters; it lies between Alappuzha and Kochi and is over 200\u0026#160;km² in area. Major lakes of Kerala include:","The Western Ghats\nis a continuous mountain range of 450\u0026#160;km along the eastern side of Kerala. It forms almost an unbroken wall guarding the eastern frontier and helps the people of Kerala to lead a sheltered life of their own through the centuries. The Western Ghats is also responsible for the high and steady rainfall in Kerala. It converts 50% of Kerala into highlands and is studded with more than 50 peaks above 5000 feet above Mean Sea Level\n. With a height of 8841 feet (2,695 metres), Anamudi\nis the highest peak in India outside Himalayas\n.","Kerala is prone to several natural hazards, the most common of them being landslides\n, flooding\n, lightning\n, drought, coastal erosion\n, earthquakes, Tsunami\n, wind fall and epidemics.[4]\n\n","The highlands of Kerala experience several types of landslides, of which debris flows\nare the most common. They are called ‘Urul Pottal’ in the local vernacular. The characteristic pattern of this phenomenon is the swift and sudden downslope movement of highly water saturated overburden containing a varied assemblage of debris material ranging in size from soil particles to boulders, destroying and carrying with it every thing that is lying in its path. The west facing Western Ghats scarps that runs the entire extent of the mountain system is the most prone physiographic unit for landslides. These scarp faces are characterised by thin soil (regolith) cover modified heavily by anthropogenic activity.[5]\n\nThe highlands of the region experience an annual average rainfall as high as 500\u0026#160;cm from the South-West, North-East and Pre-Monsoon showers. A review of ancient documents, investigation reports and news paper reports indicates a lesser rate of slope instability in the past; 29 major landslide events that occurred in the recent past was identified through the review.[6]\n\nThe processes leading to landslides were accelerated by anthropogenic disturbances such as deforestation since the early 18th century, terracing and obstruction of ephemeral streams and cultivation of crops lacking capability to add root cohesion in steep slopes. The events have become more destructive given the increasing vulnerability of population and property. Majority of mass movements have occurred in hill slopes \u0026gt;20° along the Western Ghats scarps, the only exception being the coastal cliffs. Studies conducted in the state indicates that prolonged and intense rainfall or more particularly a combination of the two and the resultant persistence and variations of pore pressure are the most important trigger of landslides.[7]\n\nThe initiation of most of the landslides were in typical hollows generally having degraded natural vegetation. All except 1 of the 14 districts in the state are prone to landslides. Wayanad and Kozhikode districts are prone to deep seated landslides while Idukki and Kottayam are prone to shallow landslides. A very recent study indicates that the additional cohesion provided by vegetation roots in soil is an important contributor to slope stability in the scarp faces of the Western Ghats of Kerala.[8]\n\n","Although the Kerala state does not experience floods as severe as in the Indo-Gangetic plains\n, incidence of floods in the State is becoming more frequent and severe. Continuous occurrence of high intensity rainfall for a few days is the primary factor contributing to the extreme floods in the State. Other factors include wrong landuse practices and mismanagement of the water resources\nand forests. The human interventions contributing to flood problems are predominantly in the form of reclamation of wetlands and water bodies, change in landuse pattern, construction of dense networks of roads, establishment of more and more settlements, deforestation in the upper catchments etc. Increasing floodplain occupancy results in increasing flood damages. Urban floods result from blocked or inadequate storm sewers and due to increased urbanization. A number of extreme flood events occurred during the last century causing considerable damage to life and property highlight the necessity for proper flood management measures in the State. The flood problems are likely to worsen with the continued floodplain occupancy and reclamation of water bodies and wetlands. It is estimated that about 25% of the total geographical area accommodating about 18% of the total population of the State is prone to floods.[4]\n\n","Kerala is a place of high lightning incidence compared to most of the other parts in India because of its weather patterns and the location of the Western Ghats. Higher population density and vegetation density result in more casualties. Lack of awareness also aggravates the situation. Accidents caused by ground conduction from trees, which is a special feature of Kerala, add to the casualties and loss of property. The records show that the months April, May, October and November have the highest lightning rates. The most active time of the day is from 15:00 to 19:00. Of the fourteen districts, five have much higher rates than others. The severe impact of the hazard on the state and its people is seen from the very high average casualty rates of 71 deaths, 112 injuries and 188 accidents per annum. Losses to telephone communications, networked systems and electrical equipment\nare also very high.[4]\n\n","Kerala has been experiencing increasing incidents of drought in the recent past due to the weather anomalies and developmental pressures resulting from the changes in land use\n, traditional practices, and life style of the people. The increase in population and subsequent expansion in irrigated agriculture, and industrial growth necessitated the exploitation of more water resources. The changes in the land and water management\npractices affected the fresh water availability during summer months. Although the deviation in the annual rainfall received in Kerala, in any year from the long term average is very small, there is considerable variation in the rainfall availability during the different seasons. About 95 percent of annual rainfall is confined to a six-month monsoon period between June and November, leaving the remaining six months as practically dry. Soman (1988) reported that over major part of the Kerala State, extreme as well as these where the rainfall is more compared to other areas. The changes in rainfall pattern may have association with the environmental modifications due to human interventions on the natural ecosystems. The State of Kerala experiences seasonal drought conditions every year during the summer months. Even in the years of normal rainfall, summer water scarcity\nproblems are severe in the midland and highland regions. Severe drought conditions often result from the anomalies in monsoon rainfall combined with the various anthropogenic pressures. A study on the incidence of droughts based on the aridity index shows that during the period 1871– 2000, the State of Kerala experienced 66 drought years, out of which, twelve each were moderate and severe droughts. The droughts have a large dimension of economic, environmental and social impacts. With the implementation of a number of irrigation projects, the idea of drought in Kerala slowly shifted to unirrigated paddy, and upland crops. The water scarcity in summer is mainly reflected in dry rivers and lowering of water table\n. This adversely affects the rural and urban drinking water supply. As seen in the majority of drought incidents, even a 20% fall in the northeast monsoon, can make the water scarcity situation worse during the summer. Since the State has more of perennial plantation crops compared to other places of India, the effect of a drought year in Kerala continues to be felt for several more years after it has occurred. Thus, for better planning of the drought management measures, the term drought with reference to plantation crops should be redefined based on rainfall received or available soil moisture\nduring summer months instead of total monsoon rainfall.[4]\n\n","The Kerala coast was significantly affected by the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami\n. The coast located in the shadow zone with respect to the direction of propagation of the tsunami encountered unexpected devastation. Although the tsunami affected parts of Kerala coast, maximum devastation was reported in the low coastal land of Kollam, Alappuzha and Ernakulam districts, particularly a strip of 10\u0026#160;km in Azhikkal, Kollam district\n. This varying effect along the coast could be attributed to local amplification of tsunami waves in certain regions. About 176 people were killed and 1600 injured in the coastal belt. Further, the tsunami pounded 187 villages affecting nearly 250,000 persons in Kerala. As many as 6,280 dwelling units were completely destroyed, 11,175 were damaged and nearly 84,773 persons were evacuated from the coastal areas and accommodated in 142 relief camps after tsunami. As this tsunami is believed to be first of its kind to have significantly affected the Kerala coast, the post-tsunami field investigations and measurements would give valuable information on various changes brought by the tsunami. Immediately after the tsunami, several organizations have carried out field surveys in many affected areas along the coast.[4]\n\n","Undergraduate and Masters level education is offered in the Universities of Kerala. Research in Geography is carried out in a variety of organizations like Department of Geography, University College, Department of Geology, University of Kerala\n, National Centre for Earth Sciences Studies, Kannur University etc."]},"downloaded":true}

dates back many millennia. Stone Age\ncarvings in the Edakkal Caves\nfeature pictorial writings believed to date to at least the Neolithic\nera around 5,000 BC, indicating the presence of a prehistoric civilisation or settlement in this region.[1]\n\nFrom as early as 3000 BC, Chera nadu, currently known as Kerala had established itself as a major spice trade\ncentre. Keralam, the then Chera nadu had direct contact across the Arabian Sea\nwith all the major Mediterranean\nand Red Sea\nports as well those of the Far East\n. The spice trade between Kerala and much of the world was one of the main drivers of the world economy. For much of history, ports in Kerala were the busiest (Muziris\n) among all trade and travel routes in the history of the world.","The word Kerala\nis first recorded (as Keralaputra\n) in a 3rd-century BC rock inscription (Rock Edict 2) left by the Maurya emperor\nAshoka\n(274–237 BC).[2]\n\nThe Land of Keralaputra was one of the five independent kingdoms in southern India during Ashoka's time, the others being Chola\n, Pandya\n, Tamiraparani and Satiyaputra\n.[3]\n\nThe Cheras collapsed after repeated attacks from the neighboring Chola Empire\nand Rashtrakuta Empire\n. In the 8th century, Adi Shankara\nwas born at Kalady in central Kerala. He travelled extensively across the Indian subcontinent\nestablishing institutions of Advaita Vedanta\nphilosophy.","Contact with Europeans after the arrival of Vasco Da Gama\nin 1498 gave rise to struggles between colonial and native interests. The state of Keralam was created in 1956 from the former state of Travancore-Cochin\n, the Malabar district\nof Madras State\n, and the Kasaragod taluk\nof Dakshina Kannada\n.[4]\n\n","","","Many historians locate port cities Ophir\nand Tarshish\nmentioned in old testament in ancient Kerala. Poovar\nnear Thiruvananthapuram\nis believed to be Ophir mentioned in old testament bible. Similarly Kollam\n, another ancient port city, is believed to be Tarshish.[5]\n\n","Many of the mythological stories in Kerala are common with the rest of India coming from the same Vedic Storytelling History. Kerala remained of pure Tamil culture, until Sanskrit mixed with it late in the 7 century CE and developed as Malayalam further.","Perhaps the most famous festival of Kerala, Onam\n, is deeply rooted in Kerala traditions. Onam is associated with the legendary Asura\nking Mahabali\n, who according to the Hindu Puranas\n, ruled the Earth and several other planetary systems from Kerala. His entire kingdom was then a land of immense prosperity and happiness. However, he was granted rule over one of the netherworld (Patala\n\n) planets called Sutala, by Vamana\n, the fifth Avatar\n(earthly incarnation) of Lord Vishnu\n\n. Onam is celebrated in Kerala with respect to Maveli Thampuran of Mavelikkara\nand Thrikkakkarayappan\n.[citation needed\n\n\n]\n","The oldest of all the Puranas, the Matsya Purana\n, sets the story of the Matsya Avatar (fish incarnation) of Lord Vishnu\n, in the Malaya Mountains\nof Dravida, which lie in Kerala and Tamil Nadu. The earliest Sanskrit text to mention Kerala by name is the Aitareya Aranyaka\nof the Rigveda\n.[6]\n\nIt is also mentioned in both the Ramayana\nand the Mahabharata\n[7]\n\n","There are myths dealing with the origins of Kerala geographically and culturally. One such myth is the retrieval of Kerala from the sea, by Parasurama, a warrior sage. It proclaims that Parasurama\n, an Avatar\nof Mahavishnu\n, threw his battle axe into the sea. As a result, the land of Kerala arose, and thus was reclaimed from the waters.[8]\n\n","He was the sixth of the ten avatars (incarnations) of Vishnu. The word Parasu means 'axe' in Sanskrit and therefore the name Parasurama means 'Ram with Axe. In Treta yuga, Parasurama retrieved the land submerged under the ocean from Varuna\n- the God of the Oceans and Bhumidevi - Goddess of Earth. From Gokarnam\nhe reached Kanyakumari\nand threw his axe northward across the ocean. The place where the axe landed was Kerala. It was 160 katam (an old measure) of land lying between Gokarnam and Kanyakumari. Puranas say that it was Parasurama who planted the Brahmins and Nayakas in 64 regions of Kerala from Chera and Pandya regions. According to the puranas, Kerala is also known as Parasurama Kshetram, i.e., 'The Land of Parasurama', as the land was reclaimed from sea by him.","Archaeological studies have identified many Mesolithic\n, Neolithic and Megalithic\nsites in Kerala.[9]\n\nThese findings have been classified into Laterite rock-cut caves (Chenkallara\n), Hood stones (Kudakkallu\n), Hat stones (Toppikallu\n), Dolmenoid cists (Kalvrtham\n), Urn burials (Nannangadi\n) and Menhirs (Pulachikallu\n). The studies point to the indigenous development of the ancient Kerala society and its culture beginning from the Paleolithic\nage, and its continuity through Mesolithic, Neolithic and Megalithic ages.[10]\n\nHowever, foreign cultural contacts have assisted this cultural formation.[11]\n\nThe studies suggest possible relationship with Indus Valley Civilization\nduring the late Bronze Age\nand early Iron Age\n.[12]\n\n","Archaeological findings include dolmens\nof the Neolithic\nera in the Marayur\narea. They are locally known as \"muniyara\", derived from muni\n(hermit\nor sage\n) and ara\n(dolmen).[13]\n\nRock engravings in the Edakkal Caves\nin Wayanad\nare thought to date from the early to late Neolithic eras around 5000 BCE.[14]\n\n[15]\n\n[16]\n\nHistorian M.R. Raghava Varier of the Kerala state archaeology department identified a sign of “a man with jar cup” in the engravings, which is the most distinct motif of the Indus valley civilisation.[17]\n\n","Kerala was a major spice exporter as early as 3000 BCE, according to Sumerian records\n.[18]\n\nIts fame as the land of spices attracted ancient Babylonians\n, Assyrians\nand Egyptians\nto Muziris\n[3]\nin the 3r and 2nd millennia BCE. Arabs\nand Phoenicians\nwere also successful in establishing their prominence in the Kerala trade during this early period.[19]\n\n[20]\n\n","According to Sumerian records and Kerala still referred to as the \"Garden of Spices\" or as the \"Spice Garden of India\". Kerala's spices attracted ancient Babylonians, Assyrians and Egyptians to the Malabar Coast in the 3rd and 2nd millennia BCE.[citation needed\n\n\n]\nArabs and Phoenicians established trade with Kerala during this period.[citation needed\n\n\n]\nThe Land of Keralaputra was one of the four independent kingdoms in southern India during Ashoka's time, the others being Chola, Pandya, and Satiyaputra.[citation needed\n\n\n]\nScholars[who?\n\n\n]\nhold that Keralaputra is an alternate name of the Cheras, the first dominant dynasty based in Kerala.","In the last centuries BCE the coast became important to the Greeks and Romans for its spices, especially black pepper\n. The Cheras had trading links with China\n, West Asia\n, Egypt\n, Greece\n, and the Roman Empire\n. In foreign-trade circles the region was known as Male\nor Malabar\n.[21]\n\nMuziris\n, Berkarai, and Nelcynda were among the principal ports at that time.[22]\n\nThe value of Rome's annual trade with the region was estimated at around 50,000,000 sesterces\n;[23]\n\ncontemporary Sangam literature\ndescribes Roman ships coming to Muziris in Kerala, laden with gold to exchange for pepper. One of the earliest western traders to use the monsoon winds to reach Kerala was Eudoxus of Cyzicus\n, around 118 or 166\u0026#160;BCE, under the patronage of Ptolemy VIII\n, king of the Hellenistic\nPtolemaic dynasty\nin Egypt. Roman establishments in the port cities of the region, such as a temple of Augustus\n\nand barracks for garrisoned Roman soldiers, are marked in the Tabula Peutingeriana\n; the only surviving map of the Roman cursus publicus\n\n.[24]\n\n[25]\n\n","Merchants from West Asia and Southern Europe established coastal posts and settlements in Kerala. The Jewish connection with Chera nadu started in 573 BCE. Arabs also had trade links with Kerala, starting before the 4th century BCE, as Herodotus (484–413 BCE) noted that goods brought by Arabs from Kerala were sold to the Jews at Eden. They intermarried with local people, resulting in formation of the Muslim Mappila community. In the 4th century, some Christians also migrated from Persia and joined the early Syrian Christian community who trace their origins to the evangelistic activity of Thomas the Apostle in the 1st century. Another Christian migration from middle east to Kerala was of the Knanaya\ncommunity. Mappila was an honorific title (Mapillai is a Tamil word for bridegroom, because foreign male partner married to local woman, they have been called Mapillai community) that had been assigned to respected visitors from abroad; Jewish, Syrian Christian, and Muslim immigration account for later names of the respective communities: Juda Mappilas, Nasrani Mappilas, and Muslim Mappilas. According to the legends of these communities, the earliest Saint Thomas Christian\nChurches, Cheraman Juma Masjid (629 CE)—the first mosque of India—and Paradesi Synagogue (1568 CE)—the oldest active synagogue in the Commonwealth of Nations—were built in Kerala by Cochin Jews\n.","Megasthanes\n, the Greek Ambassador to the court of Emperor Chandragupta Maurya\n(4th Century BC) mentions in his work Indica on many South Indian States, including Automela (probably Muziris), and a Pandian trade centre. Ancient Roman\nNatural philosopher\nPliny the Elder\nmentions in his Naturalis Historia\n\n(N.H. 6.26) Muziris\n[4]\nin Kerala as India's first port of importance. According to him, Muziris could be reached in 40 days' time from the Red sea ports in Egyptian\ncoast purely depending on the South West Monsoon winds. Later, the unknown author of the Periplus of the Erythraean Sea\n\nnotes that \"both Muziris and Nelcynda\nare now busy places\".","The Sangam\nworks Pu?ana?u?u\nand Akana?u?u\nhave many lines which speak of the Roman\nvessels and the Roman gold that used to come to the Kerala ports in search of pepper\nand other spices\n, which had enormous demand in the West. Especially, one of the earliest surviving pieces of literature to have been composed in ancient Kerala, the pathiRRuppathu\n\nis an important source that describes the dynasties of Kerala kings (cheral\nkings\n) from the early centuries AD.[26]\n\n","An important source to understand the ancient history of Kerala is the pathinEnmERkanakku\n\n. Collections of poems like Purananuru, Akananuru, Silappathikaram and Manimekhalai by poets like Paramer, Kapilar, Gautamanar, mamulanar, and Avvaiyar. The Sangam poems were secular. The poems give us information about the Chera kings like Utiyam, Neducheralathan and Chenkuttawan. Their capital was vanchi (muziris), which was an important trading centre with Rome\n.","A 3rd-century-BC rock inscription by emperor Ashoka the Great\nreferences Kerala as Keralaputra\n.[27]\n\nSanskrit scholars of ancient India, Katyayana\n(circa 4th century BC) and Patanjali\n\n(circa 2nd century BC), exhibited in their writings a casual familiarity with Kerala's geography.","The Land of Keralaputra\nwas one of the five independent kingdoms in southern India during Ashoka's time, the others being Chola\n, Pandya\n, Tamiraparani and Satiyaputra\n.[3]\n\nKerala was governed by several deshavazhi\n(governors of the region) and the Chera\n, took the title as the naduvazhi\n(governor of the area).[28]\n\n[29]\n\n[30]\n\nwhich had a trading port sometimes identified in ancient Western sources as Nelcynda\n\n(or Neacyndi\n).[31]\n\n","The Cheras ruled western Malabar Coast\n, the Cholas ruled in the eastern Coromandel Coast\nand the Pandyas in the south-central peninsula. There were also numerous small vassal kingdoms and city-states called \"Vels\". The Chera kingdom consisted of major part of modern Kerala\n, and Coimbatore\nand Salem\ndistricts of modern Tamil Nadu\n.[32]\n\n[33]\n\nOld Tamil and Sanskrit was the language of the region; Malayalam\n, .[34]\n\n[35]\n\nTheir capital was at Vanchi\n(also known as Vanchimutur).[35]\n\nThe location of the historical city Vanchi\nis generally considered near the ancient port city of Muziris\nin Kerala.[36]\n\n[37]\n\nHowever, Karur\nin Tamil Nadu is also pointed out as the location of the capital city of Cheras.[32]\n\nAnother view suggests the reign of Cheras from multiple capitals.[14]\n\n","There were harbours of Naura near Kannur, Tyndis near Koyilandy, and Bacare near Alappuzha\nwhich were also trading with Rome and Palakkad pass (churam) facilitated migration and trade. The contact with Romans might have given rise to small colonies of Jews\nand Syrian Christians in the chief harbour towns of Kerala. The Cochin Jews\nbelieve that their ancestors came to the west coast of India as refugees following the destruction of Jerusalem\nin the first century AD. Saint Thomas Christians\nare the descendants of the converts of Saint Thomas the Apostle\nof Jesus Christ\n.","Buddhism\nand Jainism\nreached Kerala in this early period. As in other parts of Ancient India\n, Buddhism and Jainism co-existed with early Dravidian beliefs during the first five centuries.","Merchants from West Asia and Southern Europe established coastal posts and settlements in Kerala.[38]\n\nJewish connection with Kerala started as early as 573 BC.[39]\n\n[40]\n\nArabs also had trade links with Kerala, possibly started before the 4th century BC, as Herodotus\n(484–413 BC) noted that goods brought by Arabs from Kerala were sold to the Jews at Eden.[22]\n\nIn the 4th century, some Christians also immigrated from Persia\nand joined the early Syrian Christian\ncommunity who trace their origins to the evangelistic activity of Thomas the Apostle\nin the 1st century.[41]\n\n[42]\n\nMappila\nwas an honorific title that had been assigned to respected visitors from abroad; and Jewish, Syrian Christian, and Muslim immigration might account for later names of the respective communities: Juda Mappilas\n, Nasrani Mappilas\n, and Muslim Mappilas\n.[43]\n\n[44]\n\nAccording to the legends of these communities\n, the earliest Christian churches\n,[45]\n\nmosque\n,[46]\n\nand synagogue\n(AD 1568)[47]\n\nin India were built in Kerala. The combined number of Jews, Christians, and Muslims was relatively small at this early stage. They co-existed harmoniously with each other and with local Hindu society, aided by the commercial benefit from such association.[48]\n\nAnother notable community arrived from middle east in Kerala is The Knanaya\n.","A silent revolution was taking place in the social system of the western coast of south India during the last phase of Sangam Age. Towards the end of Sangam age, Brahmins migrated into this region and by about the 8th century, a chain of Brahmin settlements had come up a large number of which were in Central Kerala. The process of Brahminisation or Sanskritisation began. Temples were constructed, Nambudiri\ncommunity was evolved. Adi Shankara\nthe exponent of Advaita\n(monistic) philosophy lived in the 8th century AD. The whole of Kerala came to be covered by a network of Hindu temple\ncentered Brahmin\nsettlements. Under their control, these settlements had a large extend of land, number of tenants and the entailing privileges. With more advanced techniques of cultivation, sociopolitical organisation and a strong sense of solidarity, the Brahmins gradually formed the elite of the society. They succeeded in raising a feudal fighting class and ordered the caste system with numerous graduations of upper, intermediate and lower classes.","Much of history of the region from the 6th to the 8th century is obscure.[2]\n\nA Second Chera Kingdom\n( c. 800–1102), also known as Kulasekhara dynasty of Mahodayapuram\n, was established by Kulasekhara Varman\n, which at its zenith ruled over a territory comprising the whole of modern Kerala and a smaller part of modern Tamil Nadu. During the early part of Kulasekara period\n, the southern region from Nagercoil\nto Thiruvananthapuram\nwas ruled by Ay kings\n, who lost their power in 10th century and thus the region became a part of theKulasekara empire\n.[49]\n\n[50]\n\nDuring Kulasekhara rule, Kerala witnessed a flourishing period of art, literatute, trade and the Bhakti movement\nof Hinduism.[51]\n\nA Keralite identity, distinct from the Tamils\n, became linguistically separate\nduring this period.[52]\n\nFor the local administration, the empire was divided into provinces under the rule of Nair\nChieftains known as Naduvazhis\n, with each province comprising a number of Desams\nunder the control of chieftains, called as Desavazhis\n.[51]\n\n","The inhibitions, caused by a series of Chera-Chola wars in the 11th century, resulted in the decline of foreign trade in Kerala ports. Buddhism and Jainism disappeared from the land. The social system became fractured with internal divisions on the lines of caste\n.[53]\n\nFinally, the Kulasekhara dynasty was subjugated in 1102 by the combined attack of Later Pandyas\nand Later Cholas\n.[49]\n\nHowever, in the 14th century, Ravi Varma Kulashekhara (1299-1314) of the southern Venad kingdom\nwas able to establish a short-lived supremacy over southern India. After his death, in the absence of a strong central power, the state was fractured into about thirty small warring principalities under Nair Chieftains; most powerful of them were the kingdom of Samuthiri\nin the north, Venad\nin the south and Kochi in the middle.[54]\n\n[55]\n\n","Adi Shankara\n(AD 789), one of the greatest Indian philosopher, born in Kaladi\nin Kerala\nwho consolidated the doctrine of advaita vedanta\n\n.[56]\n\n[57]\n\nShankara travelled across the Indian subcontinent\nto propagate his philosophy through discourses and debates with other thinkers. He is reputed to have founded four mathas\n\n(\"monasteries\"), which helped in the historical development, revival and spread of Advaita Vedanta of which he is known as the greatest revivalist.[57]\n\nAdi Shankara is believed to be the organiser of the Dashanami\nmonastic order and the founder of the Shanmatatradition\nof worship.","His works in Sanskrit\nconcern themselves with establishing the doctrine of advaita\n\n(nondualism\n). He also established the importance of monastic life as sanctioned in the Upanishads and Brahma Sutra, in a time when the Mimamsa\nschool established strict ritualism and ridiculed monasticism. Shankara represented his works as elaborating on ideas found in the Upanishads\n\n, and he wrote copious commentaries on the Vedic canon (Brahma Sutra\n\n, principal upanishads\nand Bhagavad Gita\n\n) in support of his thesis. The main opponent in his work is the Mimamsa\nschool of thought, though he also offers arguments against the views of some other schools like Samkhya\nand certain schools of Buddhism\n.[58]\n\n[59]\n\n[60]\n\n","Venad\nwas a kingdom in the south west tip of Kerala, which acted as a buffer between Cheras and Pandyas. Until the end of the 11th century, it was a small principality in the Ay Kingdom\n. The Ays\nwere the earliest ruling dynasty in southern Kerala, who, at their zenith, ruled over a region from Nagercoil\nin the south to Thiruvananthapuram\nin the north. Their capital was at Kollam\n. A series of attacks by the Pandyas\nbetween the 7th and 8th centuries caused the decline of Ays although the dynasty remained powerful until the beginning of the 10th century.[61]\n\nWhen Ay power diminished, Venad became the southern most principality of the Second Chera Kingdom\n[62]\n\nInvasion of Cholas into Venad caused the destruction of Kollam in 1096. However, the Chera capital, Mahodayapuram\n, fell in the subsequent attack, which compelled the Chera king, Rama varma Kulasekara, to shift his capital to Kollam.[63]\n\nThus, Rama Varma Kulasekara, the last emperor of Chera dynasty, is probably the founder of the Venad royal house, and the title of Chera kings, Kulasekara\n, was thenceforth adopted by the rulers of Venad. The end of Second Chera dynasty in the 12th century marks the independence of the Venad.[64]\n\nThe Venadu King then also was known as Venadu Mooppil Nayar.","In the second half of the 12th century, two branches of the Ay Dynasty: Thrippappur and Chirava, merged into the Venad family and established the tradition of designating the ruler of Venad as Chirava Moopan and the heir-apparent as Thrippappur Moopan\n. While Chrirava Moopan had his residence at Kollam\n, the Thrippappur Moopan resided at his palace in Thrippappur, 9 miles (14\u0026#160;km) north of Thiruvananthapuram, and was vested with the authority over the temples of Venad kingdom, especially the Sri Padmanabhaswamy temple\n.[62]\n\nThe most powerful kingdom of Kerala during the colonial period, Travancore\n, was developed through the expansion of Venad by Mahahrajah Marthanda Varma\n, a member of the Thrippappur branch of the Ay Dynasty who ascended to the throne in the 18th century.","Historical records regarding the origin of the Samoothiri of Kozhikode\nis obscure. However, its generally agreed that the Samoothiri were originally the rulers of Eralnadu region of the Later Chera Kingdom and were known as the Eradis. Eralnadu province was situated in the northern parts of present-day Malappuram district\nand was landlocked by the Valluvanad and Polanadu in the west. Legends such as The Origin of Kerala\n\ntell the establishment of a local ruling family at Nediyiruppu\n, near present-day Kondotty\nby two young brothers belonging to the Eradi clan\n. The brothers, Manikkan and Vikraman were the most trusted generals in the army of the Cheras\n.[65]\n\n[66]\n\nM.G.S. Narayanan\n, a Kerala-based historian, in his book, Calicut: The City of Truth\nstates that the Eradi was a favourite of the last Later Chera king and granted him, as a mark of favor, a small tract of land on the sea-coast in addition to his hereditary possessions (Eralnadu province). Eradis subsequently moved their capital to the coastal marshy lands and established the kingdom of Kozhikode[67]\n\nThey later assumed the title of Samudrathiri\n(\"one who has the sea for his border\") and continued to rule from Kozhikode.","Samoothiri allied with Muslim Arab and Chinese merchants and used most of the wealth from Kozhikode to develop his military power. They became the most powerful king in the Malayalam speaking regions\nduring the Middle Ages\n. In the 14th century, Kozhikode conquered large parts of central Kerala, which was under the control of the king of Kingdom of Kochi\n. He was forced to shift his capital (c. AD 1405) further south. In the 15th century, Kochi was reduced in to a vassal state of Kozhikode .","The maritime spice trade\nmonopoly in the Indian Ocean stayed with the Arabs during the High\nand Late Middle Ages\n. However, the dominance of Middle East traders was challenged in the European Age of Discovery\n. After Vasco Da Gama\n's arrival in Kappad\nKozhikode\nin 1498, the Portuguese\nbegan to dominate eastern shipping, and the spice-trade in particular.[68]\n\n[69]\n\n[70]\n\n","The Samoothiri Maharaja of Kozhikode permitted the Portuguese to trade with his subjects. Their trade in Kozhikode prospered with the establishment of a factory and fort in his territory. However, Portuguese attacks on Arab properties in his jurisdiction provoked the Samoothiri and finally led to conflict. The Portuguese took advantage of the rivalry between the Samoothiri and Rajah of Kochi\n—they allied with Kochi and when Francisco de Almeida\nwas appointed Viceroy of Portuguese India in 1505, he established his headquarters at Kochi. During his reign, the Portuguese managed to dominate relations with Kochi and established a number of fortresses along the Malabar Coast\n.[71]\n\nNonetheless, the Portuguese suffered severe setbacks due to attacks by Samoothiri Maharaja's forces, especially naval attacks under the leadership of admirals of Kozhikode known as Kunjali Marakkars\n, which compelled them to seek a treaty. The Portuguese Cemetery, Kollam\n(after the invasion of Dutch\n, it became Dutch Cemetery\n) of Tangasseri\nin Kollam\ncity was constructed in around 1519 as part of the Portuguese\ninvasion in the city. Buckingham Canal\n(a small canal between Tangasseri Lighthouse\nand the cemetery) is situated very close to the Portuguese Cemetery.[72]\n\n[73]\n\nA group of pirates known as the Pirates of Tangasseri formerly lived at the Cemetery.[74]\n\nThe remnants of St. Thomas Fort\nand Portuguese Cemetery still exist at Tangasseri.","The French East India Company\nconstructed a fort on the site of Mahé in 1724, in accordance with an accord concluded between André Mollandin and Raja Vazhunnavar of Badagara three years earlier. In 1741, Mahé de La Bourdonnais retook the town after a period of occupation by the Marathas.","In 1761 the British captured Mahé, India\n, and the settlement was handed over to the Rajah of Kadathanadu. The British restored Mahé, India\nto the French as a part of the 1763 Treaty of Paris. In 1779, the Anglo-French war broke out, resulting in the French loss of Mahé, India\n. In 1783, the British agreed to restore to the French their settlements in India, and Mahé, India\nwas handed over to the French in 1785","The weakened Portuguese were ousted by the Dutch East India Company\n, who took advantage of continuing conflicts between Kozhikode\nand Kochi\nto gain control of the trade. The Dutch Malabar\n(1661-1795) in turn were weakened by their constant battles with Marthanda Varma\nof the Travancore Royal Family\n, and were defeated at the Battle of Colachel\nin 1741, resulting in the complete eclipse of Dutch power in Malabar. The Treaty of Mavelikkara\nwas signed by the Dutch and Travancore in 1753, according to which the Dutch were compelled to detach from all political involvements in the region. In the meantime, Marthanda Varma annexed many smaller northern kingdoms through military conquests, resulting in the rise of Travancore to a position of preeminence in Kerala.[75]\n\nHyder Ali\nof Mysore\nconquered northern Kerala\nin the 18th century, capturing Kozhikode in 1766.","Hyder Ali and his successor, Tipu Sultan\n, came into conflict with the British, leading to the four Anglo-Mysore wars\nfought across southern India in the latter half of the 18th century. Tipu Sultan ceded Malabar District\nto the British in 1792, and South Kanara\n, which included present-day Kasargod District\n, in 1799. The British concluded treaties of subsidiary alliance\nwith the rulers of Cochin (1791) and Travancore (1795), and these became princely states\nof British India\n, maintaining local autonomy in return for a fixed annual tribute to the British. Malabar and South Kanara districts were part of British India's Madras Presidency\n.","Kerala Varma Pazhassi Raja (Kerul Varma Pyche Rajah, Cotiote Rajah) (3 January 1753\u0026#160;– 30 November 1805) was the Prince Regent and the de facto ruler of the Kingdom of Kottayam in Malabar, India between 1774 and 1805. He led the Pychy Rebellion (Wynaad Insurrection, Coiote War) against the English East India Company. He is popularly known as Kerala Simham\n(Lion of Kerala).","Organised expressions of discontent with British rule were not uncommon in Kerala. Uprisings of note include the rebellion by Pazhassi Raja\n, Velu Thampi Dalawa\nand the Punnapra-Vayalar revolt of 1946. In 1919, consequent to their victory in World War I, the British abolished the Islamic Caliphate\nand dismembered the Ottoman Empire\n. This resulted in protests against the British by Muslims of the Indian sub-continent known as the Khilafat Movement\n, which was supported by Mahatma Gandhi in order to draw the Muslims into the mainstream national independence movement. In 1921, the Khilafat Movement in Malabar culminated in widespread riots against the British government and Hindu population in what is now known as the Moplah rebellion\n. Kerala also witnessed several social reforms movements directed at the eradication of social evils such as untouchability\namong the Hindus, pioneered by reformists like Srinarayana guru and Chattambiswami among others. The non-violent and largely peaceful Vaikom\nSatyagraha\nof 1924 was instrumental in securing entry to the public roads adjacent to the Vaikom temple for people belonging to untouchable castes. In 1936, Sree Chithira Thirunal Balaramavarma, the ruler of Travancore\n, issued the Temple Entry Proclamation\n, declaring the temples of his kingdom open to all Hindu worshipers, irrespective of caste.","The two independent kingdoms of Travancore\nand Cochin\njoined the Union of India\nafter India gained independence in 1947. On 1\u0026#160;\nJuly 1949, the two states were merged to form Travancore-Cochin\n. On 1\u0026#160;\nJanuary 1950, Travancore-Cochin was recognised as a state. The Madras Presidency\nwas reorganised to form Madras State\nin 1947.","On 1\u0026#160;\nNovember 1956, the state of Kerala was formed by the States Reorganisation Act\nmerging the Malabar district, Travancore-Cochin (excluding four southern taluks\n, which were merged with Tamil Nadu), and the taluk of Kasargod\n, South Kanara\n.[76]\n\nIn 1957, elections for the new Kerala Legislative Assembly were held, and a reformist, Communist\n-led government came to power, under E. M. S. Namboodiripad\n.[76]\n\nIt was the first time a Communist government was democratically elected to power anywhere in the world. It initiated pioneering land reforms\n, leading to lowest levels of rural poverty in India.[77]\n\n[78]\n\n","It refused to nationalise the large estates but did provide reforms to protect manual labourers and farm workers, and invited capitalists to set up industry. Much more controversial was an effort to impose state control on private schools, such as those run by the Christians and the Nairs, which enrolled 40% of the students. The Christians, the land owning communities of Nairs and Namputhiris and the Congress Party protested, with demonstrations numbering in the tens and hundreds of thousands of people. The government controlled the police, which made 150,000 arrests (often the same people arrested time and again), and used 248 lathi charges to beat back the demonstrators, killing twenty. The opposition called on Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru\nto seize control of the state government. Nehru was reluctant but when his daughter Indira Gandhi\n, the national head of the Congress Party, joined in, he finally did so. New elections in 1959 cost the Communists most of their seats and Congress resumed control.","Later in 1967-82 Kerala elected a series of leftist coalition governments; the most stable was that led by Achutha Menon from 1969 to 1977.[79]\n\n","From 1967 to 1970, Kunnikkal Narayanan led a Naxalite\nmovement in Kerala. The theoretical difference in the communist party, i.e. CPM is the part of the uprising of Naxalbari movement in Bengal which leads to the formation of CPI(ML) in India.Due to the several difference in the ideological level the CPI-ML split into several groups. Some are come to the democratic way and some to the extreme, anarchic way. The violence alienated public opinion.[80]\n\n","The political alliance have strongly stabilised in such a manner that, with rare exceptions, most of the coalition partners stick their loyalty to the alliance. As a result, to this, ever since 1979, the power has been clearly alternating between these two fronts without any change. Politics in Kerala is characterised by continually shifting alliances, party mergers and splits, factionalism within the coalitions and within political parties, and numerous splinter groups.[81]\n\n","Modern politics in Kerala is dominated by two political fronts: the Communist party\n-led Left Democratic Front\n(LDF) and the Indian National Congress\n-led United Democratic Front\n(UDF) since the late 1970s. These two parties have alternating in power since 1982. Most of the major political parties in Kerala, except for Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), belong to one or the other of these two alliances, often shifting allegiances a number of time.[81]\n\nAccording to 2016 Kerala Legislative Assembly election results\n, the LDF has a majority in the state assembly\nseats (91/140)"]},"downloaded":true}

of Kerala\n, whose native habitat consists of wet evergreen rainforests\nat lower elevations and highland\ndeciduous\nand semi-evergreen\nforests in the east, is subject to a humid tropical climate. however, significant variations in terrain and elevation have resulted in a land whose biodiversity\nregisters as among the world’s most significant.","","","Most of Kerala's significantly biodiverse tracts of wilderness lie in the evergreen forests of its easternmost districts;[1]\n\ncoastal Kerala (along with portions of the east) mostly lies under cultivation and is home to comparatively little wildlife. Despite this, Kerala contains 9,400\u0026#160;km2\nof natural forests. Out of the approximately 7,500\u0026#160;km2\nof non-plantation\nforest cover, there are wild regions of tropical wet evergreen and semi-evergreen forests (lower and middle elevations — 3,470\u0026#160;km2\n), tropical moist and dry deciduous forests (mid-elevations — 4,100\u0026#160;km2\nand 100\u0026#160;km2\n, respectively), and montane subtropical and temperate\n(shola\n) forests (highest elevations — 100\u0026#160;km2\n). Such forests together cover 24% of Kerala's landmass.[2]\n\nKerala also hosts two of the world’s Ramsar Convention\n-listed wetlands\n: Lake Sasthamkotta\nand the Vembanad-Kol wetlands\nare noted as being wetlands of international importance\n. There are also numerous protected conservation areas, including 1455.4\u0026#160;km2\nof the vast Nilgiri Biosphere Reserve\n.","Eastern Kerala’s windward\nmountains shelter tropical moist forests\nand tropical dry forests\nwhich are generally characteristic of the wider Western Ghats: crowns of giant sonokeling\n(binomial nomenclature\n: Dalbergia latifolia\n\n— Indian rosewood\n), anjili\n(Artocarpus hirsuta\n), mullumurikku\n(Erythrina\n), Cassia\n, and other trees dominate the canopies of large tracts of virgin forest. Overall, Kerala's forests are home to more than 1,000 species of trees. Smaller flora\ninclude bamboo\n, wild black pepper\n(Piper nigrum\n), wild cardamom\n, the calamus\nrattan\npalm (Calamus rotang\n— a type of giant grass\n), and aromatic Vetiver\ngrass (Vetiveria zizanioides\n).[2]\n\n","In turn, the forests play host to such major fauna\nas the Asian elephant\n(Elephas maximus\n), Bengal tiger\n(Panthera tigris tigris\n), leopard\n(Panthera pardus\n), nilgiri tahr\n(Nilgiritragus hylocrius\n), and grizzled giant squirrel\n(Ratufa macroura\n).[2]\n\nMore remote preserves, including Silent Valley National Park\nin the Kundali Hills, harbor endangered species such as the Lion-tailed macaque\n(Macaca silenus\n), Indian sloth bear\n(Melursus (Ursus) ursinus ursinus\n), and gaur\n(the so-called \"Indian bison\" — Bos gaurus\n). More common species include the Indian porcupine\n(Hystrix indica\n), chital\n(Axis axis\n), sambar\n(Cervus unicolor\n), gray langur\n, flying squirrel\n, swamp lynx\n(Felis chaus kutas\n), boar\n(Sus scrofa\n), a variety of catarrhine\nOld World monkey\nspecies, the gray wolf\n(Canis lupus\n), and the common palm civet\n(Paradoxurus hermaphroditus\n).[3]\n\n","Many reptiles, such as tree snake\n, green snake\n, king cobra\n, viper\n, python\n, and various turtles and crocodiles are to be found in Kerala — again, disproportionately in the east. Kerala has about 453 species of birds\nsuch as the Sri Lanka frogmouth\n(Batrachostomus moniliger\n), leaf picking bird\n, Oriental bay owl\n, large frugivores like the great hornbill\n(Buceros bicornis\n) and Indian grey hornbill\n, as well as the more widespread birds such as peafowl\n, Indian cormorant\n, jungle\nand hill mynas\n, the Oriental darter\n, black-hooded oriole\n, greater racket-tailed\nand black\ndrongoes\n, bulbul\n(Pycnonotidae\n), species of kingfisher\nand woodpecker\n, jungle fowl\n, Alexandrine parakeets\n, and assorted ducks and migratory birds. Additionally, freshwater fish such as kadu\n(stinging catfish\n— Heteropneustes fossilis\n)[4]\n\nand brackishwater\nspecies such as Choottachi\n(orange chromide — Etroplus maculatus\n; valued as an aquarium\nspecimen) also are native to Kerala's lakes and waterways.[5]\n\n"]},"downloaded":true}
