It was formed on 1 November 1956 following the States Reorganisation Act\nby combining Malayalam\n-speaking regions. Spread over 38,863\u0026#160;km2\n(15,005\u0026#160;sq\u0026#160;mi), it is bordered by Karnataka\nto the north and northeast, Tamil Nadu\nto the east and south, and the Lakshadweep Sea\nto the west. With 33,387,677 inhabitants as per the 2011 Census\n, Kerala is the thirteenth-largest Indian state by population\n. It is divided into 14 districts\nwith the capital being Thiruvananthapuram\n. Thiruvananthapuram is the largest city in the state. Malayalam is the most widely spoken language and is also the official language of the state.","The Chera Dynasty\nwas the first prominent kingdom based in Kerala. The Ay kingdom\nin the deep south and the Ezhimala kingdom\nin the north formed the other kingdoms in the early years of the Common Era\n(CE or AD). The region had been a prominent spice exporter since 3000\u0026#160;BCE. The region's prominence in trade was noted in the works of Pliny\nas well as the Periplus\naround 100 CE. In the 15th century, the spice trade\nattracted Portuguese\ntraders to Kerala, and paved the way for European colonisation\nof India. At the time of Indian independence movement\nin the early 20th century, there were two major princely states\nin Kerala-Travancore State\nand the Kingdom of Cochin\n. They united to form the state of Thiru-Kochi\nin 1949. The Malabar region, in the northern part of Kerala had been a part of the Madras province\nof British India\n, which later became a part of the Madras State\npost-independence. After the States Reorganisation Act, 1956\n, the modern-day state of Kerala was formed by merging the Malabar district\nof Madras State (excluding Gudalur taluk\nof Nilgiris district\n, Topslip\n, the Attappadi\nForest east of Anakatti), the state of Thiru-Kochi (excluding four southern taluks of Kanyakumari district\n, Shenkottai and Tenkasi taluks), and the taluks of Kasaragod\n(now Kasaragod District\n) and South Kanara\n(Tulunad\n) which were a part of Madras State.","Kerala has the lowest positive population growth rate in India, 3.44%; the highest Human Development Index\n(HDI), 0.712 in 2015; the highest literacy rate, 93.91% in the 2011 census; the highest life expectancy, 77 years; and the highest sex ratio, 1,084 women per 1,000 men. The state has witnessed significant emigration, especially to Arab states of the Persian Gulf\nduring the Gulf Boom\nof the 1970s and early 1980s, and its economy depends significantly on remittances\nfrom a large Malayali\nexpatriate community. Hinduism\nis practised by more than half of the population, followed by Islam\nand Christianity\n. The culture is a synthesis of Aryan\n, Dravidian\n, Arab\n, European\ncultures,[6]\n\ndeveloped over millennia, under influences from other parts of India and abroad.","The production of pepper\nand natural rubber\ncontributes significantly to the total national output. In the agricultural sector, coconut\n, tea\n, coffee\n, cashew\nand spices are important. The state's coastline extends for 595 kilometres (370\u0026#160;mi), and around 1.1\u0026#160;million people in the state are dependent on the fishery industry which contributes 3% to the state's income. The state has the highest media exposure in India\nwith newspapers publishing in nine languages, mainly English and Malayalam. Kerala is one of the prominent tourist destinations\nof India, with backwaters\n, beaches, Ayurvedic tourism\nand tropical\ngreenery as its major attractions.","","","The name Kerala has an uncertain etymology. One popular theory derives Kerala\nfrom Kera\n(\"coconut tree\" in Malayalam) and alam\n(\"land\"); thus \"land of coconuts\",[7]\n\nwhich is a nickname for the state, used by locals, due to abundance of coconut trees.[8]\n\nThe word Kerala\nis first recorded as Keralaputra\nin a 3rd-century BCE rock inscription left by the Maurya emperor\nAshoka\n(274–237\u0026#160;BCE), one of his edicts\npertaining to welfare.[9]\n\nThe inscription refers to the local ruler as Keralaputra\n(Sanskrit for \"son of Kerala\"); or \"son of Chera[s]\". This contradicts the theory that Kera\nis from \"coconut tree\".[10]\n\nAt that time, one of three states in the region was called Cheralam\n\nin Classical Tamil: Chera\nand Kera\nare variants of the same word.[11]\n\nThe word Cheral\nrefers to the oldest known dynasty of Kerala kings and is derived from the Proto-Tamil-Malayalam word for \"lake\".[12]\n\n","The earliest Sanskrit text to mention Kerala is the Aitareya Aranyaka\nof the Rigveda\n. Kerala is also mentioned in the Ramayana\nand the Mahabharata\n, the two Hindu epics.[13]\n\nThe Skanda Purana\n\nmentions the ecclesiastical office of the Thachudaya Kaimal\nwho is referred to as Manikkam Keralar\n, synonymous with the deity of the Koodalmanikyam\ntemple.[14]\n\n[15]\n\nKeralam\nmay stem from the Classical Tamil\ncherive-alam\n(\"declivity of a hill or a mountain slope\")[16]\n\nor chera alam\n(\"Land of the Cheras\"). The Greco-Roman\ntrade map Periplus Maris Erythraei\n\nrefers to Keralaputra as Celobotra\n.[17]\n\n","According to Hindu\nmythology, the lands of Kerala were recovered from the sea by the axe-wielding warrior sage Parasurama\n, the sixth avatar\nof Vishnu\n(hence, Kerala is also called Parasurama Kshetram\n(\"The Land of Parasurama\")[18]\n\n). Parasurama threw his axe across the sea, and the water receded as far as it reached. According to legend, this new area of land extended from Gokarna\nto Kanyakumari\n.[19]\n\nThe land which rose from sea was filled with salt and unsuitable for habitation; so Parasurama invoked the Snake King Vasuki\n, who spat holy poison and converted the soil into fertile lush green land. Out of respect, Vasuki and all snakes were appointed as protectors and guardians of the land. The legend was later expanded, and found literary expression in the 17th or 18th century with Keralolpathi\n\n, which traces the origin of aspects of early Kerala society, such as land tenure and administration, to the story of Parasurama.[20]\n\nIn medieval times Kuttuvan\nmay have emulated the Parasurama tradition by throwing his spear into the sea to symbolise his lordship over it.[21]\n\n","Another much earlier Puranic\ncharacter associated with Kerala is Mahabali\n, an Asura\nand a prototypical just king, who ruled the earth from Kerala. He won the war against the Devas\n, driving them into exile. The Devas pleaded before Lord Vishnu\n, who took his fifth incarnation as Vamana\n\nand pushed Mahabali down to Patala\n(the netherworld) to placate the Devas. There is a belief that, once a year during the Onam\nfestival, Mahabali returns to Kerala.[22]\n\nThe Matsya Purana\n, among the oldest of the 18 Puranas\n,[23]\n\n[24]\n\nuses the Malaya Mountains\nof Kerala (and Tamil Nadu\n) as the setting for the story of Matsya\n, the first incarnation\nof Vishnu, and Manu\n, the first man and the king of the region.[25]\n\n[26]\n\n","A substantial portion of Kerala may have been under the sea in ancient times. Marine fossils have been found in an area near Changanacherry\n, thus supporting the hypothesis.[27]\n\nPre-historical archaeological findings include dolmens\nof the Neolithic\nera in the Marayur\narea of the Idukki district. They are locally known as \"muniyara\", derived from muni\n(hermit\nor sage\n) and ara\n(dolmen).[28]\n\nRock engravings in the Edakkal Caves\n, in Wayanad\ndate back to the Neolithic era around 6000\u0026#160;BCE.[29]\n\n[30]\n\nArchaeological studies have identified Mesolithic\n, Neolithic and Megalithic\nsites in Kerala.[31]\n\nThe studies point to the development of ancient Kerala society and its culture beginning from the Paleolithic Age\n, through the Mesolithic, Neolithic and Megalithic Ages.[32]\n\nForeign cultural contacts have assisted this cultural formation;[33]\n\nhistorians suggest a possible relationship with Indus Valley Civilization\nduring the late Bronze Age\nand early Iron Age\n.[34]\n\n","Kerala has been a major spice exporter since 3000\u0026#160;BCE, according to Sumerian records\nand it is still referred to as the \"Garden of Spices\" or as the \"Spice Garden of India\".[35]\n\n[36]\n\nKerala's spices attracted ancient Babylonians\n, Assyrians\nand Egyptians\nto the Malabar Coast in the 3rd and 2nd millennia BCE. Phoenicians\nestablished trade with Kerala during this period.[37]\n\nThe Land of Keralaputra\nwas one of the four independent kingdoms in southern India during Ashoka's time, the others being Chola\n, Pandya\n, and Satiyaputra\n.[38]\n\nScholars hold that Keralaputra is an alternate name of the Cheras\n, the first dominant dynasty based in Kerala.[39]\n\n[40]\n\nThese territories once shared a common language and culture, within an area known as Tamilakam\n.[41]\n\nAlong with the Ay kingdom\nin the south and the Ezhimala kingdom\nin the north, the Cheras\nformed the ruling kingdoms of Kerala in the early years of the Common Era (CE).[42]\n\nIt is noted in Sangam literature that the Chera king Uthiyan Cheralathan\nruled most of modern Kerala from his capital in Kuttanad\n,[43]\n\n[44]\n\nand controlled the port of Muziris\n, but its southern tip was in the kingdom of Pandyas\n,[45]\n\nwhich had a trading port sometimes identified in ancient Western sources as Nelcynda\n\n(or Neacyndi\n) in Quilon\n.[46]\n\nThe lesser known Ays\nand Mushikas\nkingdoms lay to the south and north of the Chera regions respectively.[47]\n\n[48]\n\n","In the last centuries BCE the coast became important to the Greeks and Romans for its spices, especially black pepper\n. The Cheras had trading links with China\n, West Asia\n, Egypt\n, Greece\n, and the Roman Empire\n.[49]\n\nIn foreign-trade circles the region was known as Male\nor Malabar\n.[50]\n\nMuziris\n, Berkarai, and Nelcynda were among the principal ports at that time.[51]\n\nThe value of Rome's annual trade with the region was estimated at around 50,000,000 sesterces\n;[52]\n\ncontemporary Sangam literature\ndescribes Roman ships coming to Muziris in Kerala, laden with gold to exchange for pepper. One of the earliest western traders to use the monsoon winds to reach Kerala was Eudoxus of Cyzicus\n, around 118 or 166\u0026#160;BCE, under the patronage of Ptolemy VIII\n, king of the Hellenistic\nPtolemaic dynasty\nin Egypt. Roman establishments in the port cities of the region, such as a temple of Augustus\n\nand barracks for garrisoned Roman soldiers, are marked in the Tabula Peutingeriana\n; the only surviving map of the Roman cursus publicus\n\n.[53]\n\n[54]\n\n","Merchants from West Asia and Southern Europe established coastal posts and settlements in Kerala.[55]\n\nThe Israeli (Jewish) connection with Kerala started in 573\u0026#160;BCE.[56]\n\n[57]\n\n[58]\n\nArabs also had trade links with Kerala, starting before the 4th century BCE, as Herodotus\n(484–413\u0026#160;BCE) noted that goods brought by Arabs from Kerala were sold to the Israelis [Hebrew (Jews)] at Eden.[51]\n\nIsraelis intermarried with local (Cheras Dravidian) people, resulting in formation of the Mappila\ncommunity.[59]\n\nIn the 4th century, some Christians also migrated from Persia\nand joined the early Syrian Christian\ncommunity who trace their origins to the evangelistic activity of Thomas the Apostle\nin the 1st century.[60]\n\n[61]\n\nMappila (Semitic)\nwas an honorific title that had been assigned to respected visitors from abroad; Israelite(Jewish), Syrian (Aramaic) Christian, and Muslim\nimmigration account for later names of the respective communities: Juda Mappilas\n, Nasrani Mappilas\n, and Muslim Mappilas\n.[62]\n\n[63]\n\nThe earliest Saint Thomas Christian Churches\n,[64]\n\nCheraman Juma Masjid\n(629 CE)—the first mosque of India[65]\n\n—and Paradesi Synagogue\n(1568 CE)—the oldest active synagogue in the Commonwealth of Nations\n[66]\n\n—were built in Kerala.[59]\n\n","A second Chera Kingdom\n(c. 800–1102), also known as Kulasekhara dynasty of Mahodayapuram\n(present-day Kodungallur\n), was established by Kulasekhara Varman\n, which ruled over a territory comprising the whole of modern Kerala and a smaller part of modern Tamil Nadu. During the early part of the Kulasekara period, the southern region from Nagerkovil\nto Thiruvalla\nwas ruled by Ay kings\n, who lost their power in the 10th century, making the region a part of the Kulasekara empire.[67]\n\n[68]\n\nUnder Kulasekhara rule, Kerala witnessed a developing period of art, literature, trade and the Bhakti movement\nof Hinduism.[69]\n\nA Keralite\nidentity, distinct from the Tamils\n, became linguistically separate during this period around the seventh century.[70]\n\nFor local administration, the empire was divided into provinces under the rule of Naduvazhis\n, with each province comprising a number of Desams\nunder the control of chieftains, called as Desavazhis\n.[69]\n\n","The inhibitions, caused by a series of Chera-Chola wars in the 11th century, resulted in the decline of foreign trade in Kerala ports. In addition, Portuguese invasions in the 15th century caused two major religion Buddhism\nand Jainism\nto disappear from the land. It is known that the Menons in the Malabar region of Kerala were originally strong believers of Jainism\n. [71]\n\nThe social system became fractured with divisions on caste\nlines.[72]\n\nFinally, the Kulasekhara dynasty was subjugated in 1102 by the combined attack of Later Pandyas\nand Later Cholas\n.[67]\n\nHowever, in the 14th century, Ravi Varma Kulashekhara (1299–1314) of the southern Venad kingdom\nwas able to establish a short-lived supremacy over southern India. After his death, in the absence of a strong central power, the state was divided into thirty small warring principalities; the most powerful of them were the kingdom of Samuthiri\nin the north, Venad in the south and Kochi in the middle. In the 18th Century, Travancore King Sree Anizham Thirunal Marthanda Varma\nannexed all the kingdoms up to Northern Kerala through military conquests, resulting in the rise of Travancore to pre-eminence in Kerala. The Kochi ruler sued for peace with Anizham Thirunal and Malabar came under direct British rule\nuntil India became independent\n.[73]\n\n[74]\n\n","The maritime spice trade\nmonopoly in the Indian Ocean\n(Indu Maha Samundr) stayed with the Arabs during the High\nand Late Middle Ages\n. However, the dominance of Middle East traders was challenged in the European Age of Discovery\n. After Vasco Da Gama\n's arrival in Kappad\nKozhikode\nin 1498, the Portuguese\nbegan to dominate eastern shipping, and the spice-trade in particular.[75]\n\n[76]\n\n[77]\n\nThe Zamorin\nof Kozhikode permitted the new visitors to trade with his subjects such that Portuguese trade in Kozhikode prospered with the establishment of a factory\nand a fort. However, Portuguese attacks on Arab properties in his jurisdiction provoked the Zamorin and led to conflicts between them. The Portuguese took advantage of the rivalry between the Zamorin and the King of Kochi allied with Kochi. When Francisco de Almeida\nwas appointed as Viceroy of Portuguese India in 1505, his headquarters was established at Fort Kochi\n(Fort Emmanuel\n) rather than in Kozhikode. During his reign, the Portuguese managed to dominate relations with Kochi and established a few fortresses on the Malabar Coast.[78]\n\nHowever, the Portuguese suffered setbacks from attacks by Zamorin forces; especially from naval attacks under the leadership Kozhikode admirals known as Kunjali Marakkars\n, which compelled them to seek a treaty.

It was previously named Capra warryato\nby Gray\n.[3]\n\n","The genus name Nilgiritragus\ncomes from the Sanskrit\nword Neelgiri\nmeaning \"blue hills\" and the Greek\nword trágos\n\nmeaning \"goat\".[4]\n\n[5]\n\n","Its closest relatives are sheep\n(genus Ovis\n). Until 2005, it was placed with the Himalayan tahr\n(Hemitragus jemlahicus\n) and the Arabian tahr\n(Arabitragus jayakari\n) in the genus Hemitragus\n. However, it has recently been transferred to a new genus Nilgiritragus\nbecause it is genetically\nmore similar to members of the genus Ovis\n\nthan to other tahrs.[6]\n\n","The Nilgiri tahr is a stocky goat with short, coarse fur and a bristly mane. Males are larger than females and of darker color when mature. Both sexes have curved horns, reaching up to 40 centimetres (16\u0026#160;in) for males and 30 centimetres (12\u0026#160;in) for females. Adult males weigh 80 to 100 kilograms (180 to 220\u0026#160;lb) and stand about 100 centimetres (39\u0026#160;in) tall at the shoulder. Adult males develop a light grey area on their backs and are thus called \"saddlebacks\".[2]\n\n","The Nilgiri tahr inhabits the open montane grassland\nhabitat of the South Western Ghats montane rain forests\necoregion. At elevations from 1,200 to 2,600 metres (3,900 to 8,500\u0026#160;ft), the forests open into grasslands interspersed with pockets of stunted forests, locally known as sholas\n\n. These grassland habitats are surrounded by dense forests at the lower elevations. The Nilgiri tahrs formerly ranged over these grasslands in large herds, but hunting and poaching in the nineteenth century reduced their population.[1]\n\n[7]\n\n","As few as 100 Nilgiri tahrs were left in the wild by the early 20th century. Since that time their numbers have inceased somewhat; in a comprehensive study of the Nilgiri tahr population in Western Ghats, the WWF-India has put the population at 3,122.[8]\n\nTheir range extends over 400 kilometres (250\u0026#160;mi) from north to south, and Eravikulam National Park\nis home to the largest population. As per the Wildlife census conducted by Kerala forest department in association with volunteers from College of Forestry \u0026amp; Veterinary Science under Kerala Agricultural University, from April 24–28, 2014, number of animals in Eravikulam National Park has increased to 894 individuals. This is the highest ever count recorded in the national park, with the first census in 1996 finding only 640 tahrs.[7]\n\nThe other significant concentration is in the Nilgiri Hills\n, with smaller populations in the Anamalai Hills\n, Periyar National Park, Palni Hills and other pockets in the Western Ghats south of Eravikulam, almost to India's southern tip. A small populations of tahr numbering around 200 are known to inhabit the Boothapandi, Azhakiyapandipuram, Velimalai, Kulasekaram and Kaliyal Ranges in the Kanyakumari district\nof Tamil Nadu\n[9]\n\nand another small herd of less than 30 animals is known to inhibit Ponmudi hills in Trivandrum district of Kerala\n[10]\n\n","female","juvenile","in mountain grasslands","The Nilgiri Tahrs making their way down the mountain","adult male and a pallid harrier (female)","[1]\n\n"]},"downloaded":true},"d2":{"_id":{"$oid":"5a86b1970262df3c25390fbc"},"title":"/wiki/Indian_giant_squirrel","content":{"title":"Indian giant squirrel","rels":["/wiki/Renee_M._Borges","/wiki/Digital_object_identifier","/wiki/Digital_object_identifier","/wiki/Digital_object_identifier","/wiki/Stanley_Henry_Prater","/wiki/International_Standard_Book_Number","/wiki/Digital_object_identifier","/wiki/International_Standard_Book_Number","/wiki/Animal","/wiki/Chordate","/wiki/Mammal","/wiki/Rodent","/wiki/Sciuromorpha","/wiki/Cream-coloured_giant_squirrel","/wiki/Black_giant_squirrel","Undefined Attribute","/wiki/Grizzled_giant_squirrel","/wiki/Neotropical_pygmy_squirrel","/wiki/Wikidata","/wiki/Animal_Diversity_Web","/wiki/ARKive","/wiki/Encyclopedia_of_Life","/wiki/Global_Biodiversity_Information_Facility","/wiki/INaturalist","/wiki/Integrated_Taxonomic_Information_System","/wiki/IUCN_Red_List","/wiki/Mammal_Species_of_the_World","/wiki/National_Center_for_Biotechnology_Information","/wiki/CITES","/wiki/Indian_giant_squirrel","/wiki/Indian_giant_squirrel"],"contents":["The Indian giant squirrel\n, or Malabar giant squirrel\n, (Ratufa indica\n) is a large tree squirrel\nspecies genus Ratufa\n\nnative to India\n.

national park in Kerala). This national park has some rare species of flora and fauna. It is located in the Nilgiri hills\n, within the palakkad District\nof Kerala\n, South India\n. This region was explored in 1847 by the botanist Robert Wight\n,[1]\n\nThis park is one of the last undisturbed tracts of South Western Ghats mountain rain forests\nand tropical moist evergreen forest\nin India\n. Contiguous with the proposed Karimpuzha National Park\n(225\u0026#160;km2\n) to the north and Mukurthi National Park\n(78.46\u0026#160;km2\n) to the north-east, it is the core of the Nilgiri International Biosphere Reserve\n(1,455.4\u0026#160;km2\n), and is part of The Nilgiri Sub-Cluster (6,000+\nkm2\n), Western Ghats\nWorld Heritage Site\n, recognised by UNESCO\nin 2007.[2]\n\n","Plans for a hydroelectric\nproject that threatened the park's rich\nwildlife\nstimulated an environmentalist\nsocial movement\nin the 1970s, known as the Save Silent Valley\nmovement, which resulted in cancellation of the project and creation of the park in 1980. The visitors' centre for the park is at Sairandhri\n.","","","The Silent Valley region is locally known as \"Sairandhrivanam\n\", which in Malayalam\nmeans Sairandhri's Forest\n. Sairandhri is Draupadi\n, the wife of the Pandavas\nin the epic Mahabharatha, who disguised herself as Sairandhri, the maid of a queen named Sudeshna, while her family was in exile.[3]\n\nThe Pandavas, deprived of their kingdom, set out on a 13-year exile. They wandered south, into what is now Kerala, until one day they came upon a magical valley where rolling grasslands met wooded ravines, a deep green river bubbled its course through impenetrable forest, where at dawn and twilight the tiger and elephant would drink together at the water's edge, where all was harmonious and man unknown. Beside that river, in a cave on a hill slope, the Pandavas halted.[4]\n\n","The first Western investigation of the watersheds\nof the Silent Valley area was in 1857 by the botanist Robert Wight\n.[1]\n\nThe British named the area Silent Valley because of a perceived absence of noisy cicadas\n. Another story attributes the name to the anglicisation of Sairandhri. A third story, refers to the presence there of many lion-tailed macaques Macaca silenus\n\n.[5]\n\nIn 1914 the forest of the Silent Valley area was declared a reserve forest\n, however, from 1927 to 1976 portions of the Silent Valley forest area were subjected to forestry\noperations. In 1928 the location on the Kunthipuzha\nRiver at Sairandhri was identified as an ideal site for electricity generation\nand in 1958 a study and survey of the area was conducted and a hydroelectric project of 120 MV costing Rs. 17 crore was proposed by the Kerala State Electricity Board\n.[6]\n\n","Silent Valley is home to the largest population of lion-tailed macaques\n, an endangered species\nof primate\n. Public controversy over their habitat led to the establishment of Silent Valley National Park.","In 1973 the valley became the focus of \"Save Silent Valley\", India's fiercest environmental\nmovement of the decade, when the Kerala State Electricity Board decided to implement the Silent Valley Hydro-Electric Project (SVHEP) centered on a dam\nacross the Kunthipuzha River\n. The resulting reservoir would flood 8.3\u0026#160;km2\nof virgin rainforest\nand threaten the lion-tailed macaque. In 1976 the Kerala State Electricity Board announced plans to begin dam construction and the issue was brought to public attention. Romulus Whitaker\n, founder of the Madras Snake Park and the Madras Crocodile Bank\n, was probably the first person to draw public attention to the small and remote area.[7]\n\n","In 1983 the then Prime Minister of India\n, Indira Gandhi\n, decided to abandon the Project and on November 15 the Silent Valley forests were declared as a National Park. On September 7, 1985 the Silent Valley National Park was formally inaugurated and a memorial at Sairandhri to Indira Gandhi was unveiled by Sri. Rajiv Gandhi\n, her son and the next Prime Minister. On September 1, 1986 Silent Valley National Park was designated as the core area of the Nilgiri Biosphere Reserve\n. Since then, a long-term conservation effort has been undertaken to preserve the Silent Valley ecosystem\n.[6]\n\n","In 2001 a new hydro project was proposed and the \"Man vs. Monkey debate\" was revived. The proposed site of the dam (64.5 m high and 275 m long) is just 3.5\u0026#160;km downstream of the old dam site at Sairandhiri, 500 m outside the National Park boundary.[8]\n\nThe Kerala Minister for Electricity called The Pathrakkadavu dam (PHEP) an \"eco-friendly alternative\" to the old Silent Valley project. The claim was that the submergence area of the PHEP would be a negligible .041\u0026#160;km2\ncompared to 8.30\u0026#160;km2\nsubmergence of the 1970s (SVHEP).[9]\n\nFrom January to May 2003, a rapid Environmental Impact Assessment\n(EIA) was carried out. On November 15, Minister for Forest Binoy Viswam said that the proposed buffer zone\nfor Silent Valley would be declared soon.[10]\n\n","On February 21, 2007 ex-Chief Minister A. K. Antony told reporters after a cabinet meeting that \"when the Silent Valley proposal was dropped, the centre had promised to give clearance to the Pooyamkutty project. This promise, however, had not been honoured. The Kerala government has not taken any decision\non reviving the Silent Valley Hydel Project\".[11]\n\n","On April 18, 2007, Kerala Chief Minister V S Achuthanandan and his cabinet approved the Pathrakkadavu Hydro-electric project and sent it to the Union Government\nfor environmental approval.[12]\n\n[13]\n\n","Territorial forests located around the national park have been subject to a working-plan to accomplish revenue oriented objectives such as extraction of bamboo and reed which affect the long-term conservation of the park. In addition Illegal activities such as ganja cultivation, setting forest fires, trapping and poaching wild animals, frequently occur in the territorial forests located in the immediate vicinity of the national park. This has resulted in degradation of habitat and reduced forest cover, which has adverse effects on the long-term survival of the core area of the national park.[14]\n\n","Silent Valley National Park Bridge","On November 21, 2009, Union Minister of Forest and Environment Jairam Ramesh\nand Kerala Forest Minister Binoy Viswam declared, while inaugurating the silver jubilee celebration of Silent Valley National Park in Palakkad, that the buffer zone of the Park would be made an integral part of it in order to ensure better protection of the area.[15]\n\nThis means that the total park area is now increased to 236.74 square kilometres (91\u0026#160;sq\u0026#160;mi). It is now the largest national park in Kerala.[1]\n","On June 6, 2007 the Kerala cabinet approved the buffer zone proposal. The new 147.22\u0026#160;km2\nzone will include 80.75\u0026#160;km2\ntaken from Attapady Forest Range, 27.09\u0026#160;km2\nfrom Mannarkkad Forest Range and 39.38\u0026#160;km2\nfrom Kalikavu Forest Range and consolidated to form a new range, Bhavani Forest Range, of 94\u0026#160;km2\nand 54\u0026#160;km2\nwould be brought under the existing Silent Valley Range of the National Park. The Cabinet also sanctioned 35 staff to protect the area and two new forest stations in Bhavani range at Anavai and Thudukki. Forest Minister Benoy Viswom said \"the zone would have reserve forest status and tribals in the area would not be affected. The decision reaffirmed the commitment of the LDF\nGovernment to protection of environment. The zone is a necessity, not just of the State but also of the nation.\"[16]\n\n","The proposal was then sent to Kerala Minister for Electricity, Mr. A.K. Balan, who has voiced the need for setting up the Pathrakadavu hydroelectric project in the proposed southwest buffer zone of the National Park, the Thenkara Range of the Mannarkkad Forest Division. As of May 9, 2007 Mr. Balan has not given his opinion on the buffer zone proposal.[17]\n\n","In August 2006, the new Minister for Forests, Benoy Viswom, approved a proposal from the Conservator of Forests for a 148\u0026#160;km2\nbuffer zone around the core area of the park. The proposal says: \"It is felt absolutely essential that an effective buffer of forests should be immediately formed around the national park in order to save the world famous Silent Valley National Park from all potential dangers. This can only be achieved by bringing the management of Silent Valley National Park as well as the proposed buffer zone under one management umbrella to insulate the park from all possible dangers.\" The proposed buffer zone will have 94\u0026#160;km2\nin Attappady Reserve Forest east of the Kunthipuzha and 54\u0026#160;km2\ntaken from the Mannarkaad range and Nilambur south division west of the river.","In January 2006, the former Kerala Minister for Forest and Environment, A. Sujanapal, said the Government would consider the demand for a 600\u0026#160;km2\nbuffer zone for Silent Valley National Park made by Bharathapuzha Protection Committee, Malampuzha Protection Committee, One Earth One Life and Jana Jagratha. A buffer zone proposal was made in the 1986 park management plan but not implemented.[18]\n\n","In 1979, Dr. M.S. Swaminathan\n, then Secretary to the Department of Agriculture, visited the Silent Valley area and suggested that 389.52\u0026#160;km2\nincluding the Silent Valley (89.52\u0026#160;km2\n), New Amarambalam\n(80\u0026#160;km2\n), Attappadi\n(120\u0026#160;km2\n) in Kerala and Kunda in Coimbatore\n(100\u0026#160;km2\n) reserve forests\n, should be developed into a National Rainforest Biosphere Reserve\n.[19]\n\n","Silent Valley is rectangular, twelve kilometres from north to south and seven from east to west. Located between 11°03' to 11°13' N (latitude) and 76°21' to 76°35' E (longitude) it is separated from the eastern and northern high altitude plateaus\nof the (Nilgiris Mountains\n) by high continuous ridges including Sispara Peak\n(2,206 m) at the north end of the park. The park gradually slopes southward down to the Palakkad\nplains and to the west it is bounded by irregular ridges. The altitude varies from 658 m to 2328 m at Anginda Peak\n, but most of the park lies within the altitude range of 880 m to 1200 m. Soils are blackish and slightly acidic in evergreen forests where there is good accumulation of organic matter. The underlying rock in the area is granite\nwith schists\nand gneiss\n, which give rise to the loamy laterite\nsoils on slopes.[20]\n\n","The Kuntipuzha River drains\nthe entire 15\u0026#160;km length of the park from north to south into the Bharathapuzha\nRiver. Kuntipuzha River divides the park into a narrow eastern sector of width 2 kilometers and a wide western sector of 5 kilometers. The river is characterized by its crystal clear water and perennial nature. The main tributaries\nof the river, Kunthancholapuzha, Karingathodu, Madrimaranthodu, Valiaparathodu and Kummaathanthodu originate on the upper slopes of the eastern side of the valley. The river is uniformly shallow, with no flood plains or meanders. Its bed falls from 1,861 m to 900 m over a distance of 12\u0026#160;km, the last 8\u0026#160;km being particularly level with a fall of only 60 m. Kuntipuzha is one of the less torrential rivers of the Western Ghats, with a pesticide-free catchment area.[21]\n\n","Silent Valley gets copious amounts of rainfall\nduring the monsoons\n, but the actual amount varies within the region due to the varied topography. In general, rainfall is higher at higher altitudes and decreases from the west to the east due to the rain shadow\neffect. Eighty per cent of the rainfall occurs during the south-west monsoon between June and September. The park also receives a significant amount of rainfall during the north-east monsoon between October and November.[22]\n\n","The park being completely enclosed within a ring of hills, has its own micro-climate\nand probably receives some convectional rainfall\n, in addition to rain from the two monsoons. In the remaining months, condensation\non vegetation of mist\nshrouding the valley is estimated to yield 15 per cent of the total water generated in the rainforest.[23]\n\n","In 2006, the Walakkad area of the park received the highest ever annual rainfall of 9,569.6\u0026#160;mm.

Falls\n, is situated in Athirappilly\nPanchayat, Chalakudy\nTaluk, Thrissur District\nof Kerala\n, India\non the Chalakudy River\n, which originates from the upper reaches of the Western Ghats\nat the entrance to the Sholayar ranges.It is the largest waterfall in Kerala, which stands tall at 80 feet. Just a short drive from Athirapally to the Vazhachal falls\n, which is close to dense green forests that are home to many endangered and endemic species of flora and fauna.","There is another waterfall on the way from Athirappilly to Vazhachal Falls\n, in close proximity to the road, which is locally called \"Charpa Falls\n\". Athirappilly Falls is the largest waterfall in Kerala and is nicknamed \"The Niagara\nof India\".[1]\n\n","Controversy about a state-proposed hydroelectric dam on the Chalakudy River above the waterfalls began in the 1990s and continued through 2017.","","","The 145 kilometres (90\u0026#160;mi) long Chalakudy River, originates in the Anamudi\nmountains of the Western Ghats\n[2]\n\nand flows through the Vazhachal Forest toward the Arabian Sea. The river initially runs smoothly but becomes more turbulent as it nears Athirapilly. At Athirappilly Falls, the water surges around big rocks and cascades down in three separate plumes. Below the falls, the river remains turbulent for about 1 kilometre (0.62\u0026#160;mi) until it reaches Kannamkuzhi. Then it calms and flows smoothly until reaching the dam at Thumburmuzhi.","Forest wildlife in the area includes the Asiatic elephant\n, tiger\n, leopard\n, bison\n, sambar\n, and lion-tailed macaque\n. The unique 180 metres (590\u0026#160;ft) elevation riparian forest in the Athirappilly-Vazhachal area is the only location where all four South Indian species of hornbills — the great hornbill\n(the state bird of Kerala), Malabar pied hornbill\n, Malabar grey hornbill\n, and the Indian grey hornbill\nare found living together. If the proposed 163-MW Athirappilly hydroelectric project is built, these unique birds may vanish from these forests because it will submerge the hornbills' habitat.[3]\n\n","Plantations in the area contain teak\n, bamboo\n, and eucalyptus\n. Environmentalists claim that Athirappilly is a one-of its-kind riparian ecosystem in Kerala. V.S. Vijayan, Chairman of the Kerala State Biodiversity Board and former Director of the Salim Ali Centre for Ornithology and Natural History (SACON), Coimbatore, has been quoted in Down to Earth magazine as affirming that the Vazhachal forest division is the second most biodiverse area in the State. The International Bird Association has declared it an ‘Important Bird Area' and the Asian Nature Conservation Foundation has recommended that the area should be declared a sanctuary or a national park, he points out. The Wildlife Trust of India says it represents one of India's best elephant conservation efforts. “Any disruption to this fragile ecosystem will spell disaster,” says Vijayan. [4]\n\nThe river provides habitat for 85 species of fresh water fishes. Among these, 35 are endemic species.","The railway station nearest Athirappilly Falls is 30\u0026#160;kilometres\u0026#160;(19\u0026#160;mi)\nto the west in Chalakudi Railway Station\n, and the nearest airport is Kochi International Airport\n, about 55\u0026#160;kilometres\u0026#160;(34\u0026#160;mi)\nsouthwest of the waterfall and 58\u0026#160;kilometres\u0026#160;(36\u0026#160;mi)\nsouth of City of Thrissur\n.[5]\n\nAthirappilly is easily reachable from Chalakudy\nby taxi or by bus from the Chalakudy\nprivate bus terminal. Athirappilly is situated on the highways connecting Tamil Nadu\nand Kerala\n, amidst thick forest, so night riding is not advised.","The journey from Chalakudy\nto the Athirappilly Falls passes through a landscape of winding roads, small villages and lush green trees. Visitors can reach the top of the waterfall via a paved path that leads through thick bamboo clusters. A steep narrow path also leads to the bottom of the falls. The falls attract visitors from across India, especially during the monsoon\nmonths (June–September). About 7 million tourists visit the falls and the Vazhachal picnic spot each year.[6]\n\n","Daily jungle safari trips are organized by Thrissur District Tourism Promotion Council with Athirappilly Destination Management Counci from Chalakudy\nto Malakkappara.","The scenic beauty of Athirappilly falls has always been attractive to filmmakers. It has been used as a location for several Malayalam films\n.","Some of the major films with scenes around the falls are:","In 1994, the Kerala State Electricity Board (KSEB) proposed a 163 megawatt Athirappilly Hydro Electric Project. It was to include a dam 23\u0026#160;metres\u0026#160;(75\u0026#160;ft)\nhigh and 311\u0026#160;metres\u0026#160;(1,020\u0026#160;ft)\nwide on the Chalakudy River in the Vazhachal Forest Division about 5\u0026#160;kilometres\u0026#160;(3\u0026#160;mi)\nupstream of Athirappilly Falls and 400\u0026#160;metres\u0026#160;(1,312\u0026#160;ft)\nupstream of Vazhachal Rapids (Vazhachal Falls).[7]\n\nHowever, environmental groups and people's collectives opposed the project on grounds that it would damage the environment, infringe on human rights, and threaten tourism.[8]\n\nThough it was not their main concern, critics also noted that if the entire course of the river were diverted to make electricity, the Athirappilly-Vazhachal waterfalls could dry up. To avoid damaging the falls, the KSEB proposed adjusting the water releases to maintain the falls.[9]\n\nThe debate continued in 2007. Environmentalists also expressed concern over whether the proposed hydroelectric project at Athirappilly waterfalls would lead to displacement and eventual extinction of the primitive tribal group, 'Kadars,' in the area. [10]\n\n","In 2005, the Kerala Ministry of Environment and Forests approved the project on the basis of a report by Water and Power Consultancy Services (India) Ltd. (WAPCOS), an environmental impact assessment\n(EIA) agency. In 2006, the Kerala High Court\nquashed the clearance and ordered another public hearing.[11]\n\n[12]\n\nThe debate continued the following years.","On 29th Jan 2011, the chairman of the Western Ghats Ecology Expert Panel (WGEEP) Madhav Gadgil\nopined that the Environment Impact Assessment (EIA) of the Athirappilly hydel power project was not properly carried out and 70% of it is bogus. The panel, appointed by the Union Ministry of Environment and Forests, was asked to look into and give recommendations on various projects in the Western Ghats such as the hydroelectric projects in Gundiya in Karnataka and Athirappilly in Kerala and the overall development projects in Ratnagiri and Sindhudurg districts of Maharashtra. Gadgil said that the proposed Athirappilly hydro-electric project cannot be approved until the Forest Rights Act is implemented in its true spirit for the Kadar tribal community of the area and also no comprehensive study had been carried out so far on the natural riparian forest vegetation along the Western Ghats.[13]\n\n[14]\n\n[15]\n\nOn 14th Jun 2011, Union Minister for Environment and Forests Jairam Ramesh\nsaid his ministry would not grant approval to the Athirappilly hydro electric project.[16]\n\nThe minister also stated “When states are denied such projects on larger and long-term environmental considerations, they are entitled to some sort of green bonus,”[17]\n\nThe first part of WGEEP report was submitted to the Ministry on August 31.The Western Ghats Ecology Expert Panel (WGEEP), on Sep 6th 2011 recommended to the Union Ministry of Environment and Forests against granting permission to carry out any construction activities at the sensitive Athirappilly-Vazhachal region. The panel, which submitted its report to Union Environment Minister Jayanti Natarajan in the capital, named Athirappilly as one of the 18 eco-sensitive localities (ESL) in the state.[18]\n\nBut K. Radhakrishnan, a former member (generation), KSEB, has opined that this panel report was highly biased with vested interests and the project was eco-friendly doing minimum damage to environment and forests.[19]\n\n[20]\n\n[21]\n\nWhile there are reports from renowned experts from Kerala State Biodiversity Board that the power project would adversely affect the ecology of the area and the estimated power output would be dependable upon the rainfall and dry summer seasons, which is undependable in its own way. M. Sivasankar, a KSEB chairman and MD states the need of more environment-friendly power projects with lower operating cost and higher output like super critical boiler\nplants. Cheemeni Power Project which is planned to produce 1500 MW is such a project in the government

Wildlife Sanctuary\n(Malayalam\n: ?????? ???????? ???????\n) is an animal sanctuary\nin Wayanad\n, Kerala\n, India\n. It has an extent of 344.44\u0026#160;km2\nwith four ranges namely Sulthan Bathery, Muthanga, Kurichiat and Tholpetty. A variety of large wild animals such as Indian bison\n, elephant\n, deer\nand tiger\nare found there. There are also quite a few unusual birds in the sanctuary. In particular, peafowl\ntend to be very common in the area. Wayanad Wildlife Sanctuary is the second largest wildlife sanctuary in Kerala. It is bestowed with lush green forests and rich wildlife.This wildlife area houses some of the rare and endangered species\nof both flora and fauna.","Established in 1973, the sanctuary is now an integral part of the Nilgiri Biosphere Reserve\n. It is bounded by protected area network of Nagarhole\nand Bandipur\nof Karnataka\nin the northeast, and on the southeast by Mudumalai\nof Tamil Nadu\n.","It is part of the Wayanad Plateau\nand the vegetation is predominantly of the south Indian moist deciduous teak forests. Also, the sanctuary has pastures of the west-coast semi-evergreen trees. The wildlife sanctuary comes under Protect Elephant and one can spot herd of elephants roaming in the area. Elephant rides are arranged by the Kerala Forest Department\n.","Wayanad district has the largest population of Adivasi\nin Kerala. Scheduled tribes here include Paniyas\n, Kurumas\n, Adiyars\n, Kurichyas\n, Ooralis\nand Kattunaikkans\n. Comprising an area of 2126\u0026#160;km2\n, Wayanad has a powerful history. Relicts and edicts found in various parts of Wayanad speak of an important prehistoric era. Historians are of the view that organised human life existed in these parts, at least ten centuries before Christ.","The sanctuary is part of the Nilgiri Biosphere Reserve. The Western Ghats\n, Nilgiri Sub-Cluster\n(6,000+\nkm²), including all of the sanctuary, is under consideration by the World Heritage Committee\nfor selection as a World Heritage Site\n.[2]\n\n","","","Wayanad Wildlife Sanctuary was formed in 1973 and was brought under the Project Elephant in 1991–92. This sanctuary occupies an area of 345\u0026#160;km2\n. It is the second largest one in the state of Kerala\n. The sanctuary is separated into two disconnected parts known as the North Wayanad Wildlife Sanctuary and South Wayanad Wildlife Sanctuary. The area in between the two parts was originally a forest region, though it is now occupied majorly by plantations.","In 2012, a tiger was shot dead by the Kerala Forest Department on a coffee plantation on the fringes of the Wayanad Wildlife Sanctuary. Many local political leaders applauded the killing of the tiger. Chief Wildlife Warden of Kerala ordered the hunt for the animal after mass protests erupted as the tiger had been carrying away domestic animals.","Flora:\nMoist deciduous forest consists of maruthi, karimaruthi, rosewood, venteak, vengal, chadachi, mazhukanjiram, bamboos, more, while the semi-evergreen patches comprises veteria indica., lagerstroemia, lanceolata, termianalia paniculata.","Fauna:\nElephants, tigers, panthers, jungle cats, civet cats, monkeys, wild dogs, bisons, deer, bears, monitor lizards and a variety of snakes are seen.","Avian-Fauna:\nPeacocks, babblers, cuckoos, owls, woodpeckers, jungle fowls are a few of the various types of birds seen here.","Wayanad climate is salubrious. Average rain fall in this district is 2322 m.m. Annual rain fall in these high rain fall areas ranges from 3,000 to 4,000\u0026#160;mm. High velocity winds are common during the south west monsoon and dry winds blow in March–April. High altitude regions experience severe cold. This place experiences a high relative humidity which goes even up to 95 per cent during the south west monsoon period. Generally, the year is classified into four seasons, namely, cold weather, hot weather, south west monsoon and north east monsoon. The dale, 'Lakkidi', nestled among the hills of Vythiri taluk has the highest average rainfall in Kerala.","Location:\nThe south Wayanad division is located 16\u0026#160;km east of Sulthan Bathery and north wayanad division 20\u0026#160;km from Mananthavady in the state of Kerala\n.","Wayanad Wildlife Sanctuary is one of the safest havens for different species of vultures like the White-rumped Vultures\nand the Red-headed Vultures\n. The collective population of these vultures numbered around 150 in February 2016 dropped to about 70 in March 2016. A survey last year counted as many as 17 vulture nests, however, this number reduced to about 11 vulture nests in March 2016. The banned drug Diclofenac\nis believed to be the reason for this fall in the vulture count.[3]\n\n","Reference Link\u0026#160;: https://www.gotirupati.com/wayanad-wildlife-sanctuary\n"]},"downloaded":true},"d9":{"_id":{"$oid":"5a86b1aa0262df3c25390fc3"},"title":"/wiki/Kuttanad","content":{"title":"Kuttanad","rels":["/wiki/Lower_Kuttanad","/wiki/Upper_Kuttanad","/wiki/North_Kuttanad","/wiki/Pallithanam_Luca_Matthai","/wiki/Renji_Panicker","/wiki/Nedumudi_Venu","/wiki/Ayyappa_Panikkar","/wiki/Kavalam_Narayana_Panikkar","/wiki/Thakazhi_Sivasankara_Pillai","/wiki/Jnanpith","/wiki/Vinayan","/wiki/K._M._Panikkar","/wiki/K_P_Sasidharan","/wiki/Baselios_Geevarghese_II","/wiki/Kuriakose_Elias_Chavara","/wiki/John_Abraham_(director)","/wiki/Kunchacko_Boban","/wiki/I._C._Chacko,_Illiparambil","/wiki/Physicist","/wiki/Geologist","/wiki/Thomas_Chandy","/wiki/Ramesh_Chennithala","/wiki/Guru_Gopinath","/wiki/Indian_classical_dance","/wiki/K._C._Joseph_(Kuttanadu_politician)","/wiki/Kunchacko","/wiki/Film_producer","/wiki/Mar_Thomas_Kurialacherry","/wiki/Oommen_Mathew","/wiki/Politician","/wiki/Venu_Nagavally","/wiki/Mankompu_Sivasankara_Pillai","/wiki/Kathakali","/wiki/Ayyappa_Panikkar","/wiki/Kavalam_Narayana_Panikkar","/wiki/Thakazhi_Sivasankara_Pillai","/wiki/Jnanpith","/wiki/Nedumudi_Venu","/wiki/Vinayan","/wiki/Joseph_Pallithanam","/wiki/Botanist","/wiki/Social_activist","/wiki/Ponkunnam_Varkey","/wiki/Novelist","/wiki/Sebastian_Xavier","/wiki/South_Asian_Games","/wiki/K_P_Sasidharan","/wiki/Edathua","/wiki/Kavalam","/wiki/Chengannur","/wiki/Champakulam","/wiki/Kandankary","/wiki/Kainakary","/wiki/The_Hindu","/wiki/Kuttanad","/wiki/Kuttanad"],"contents":["Kuttanad\nis a region covering the Alappuzha and Kottayam Districts, in the state of Kerala\n, India, well known for its vast paddy fields and geographical peculiarities. The region has the lowest altitude in India, and is one of the few places in the world where farming is carried around 1.2 to 3.0 metres (4 to 10\u0026#160;ft) below sea level. Kuttanadu is historically important in the ancient history of South India and is the major rice producer in the state. Farmers of Kuttinad are famous for Biosaline Farming. FAO has declared the Kuttanad Farming System as a Globally Important Agricultural Heritage Systems (GIAHS). Four of Kerala's major rivers, the Pamba\n, Meenachil\n, Achankovil\nand Manimala\nflow into the region. It is well known for it boat race in the Punnamada Backwaters. Also known in Malayalam as:(Vallamkalli).","","","The first recorded history on the origin of this land is obtained from Sangam period\nliterature. Additionally the oral history among local people, transferred from generation to generation is a blend of myths and legends is a valuable resource. According to Sangam era documents, Uthiyan Cheralatan\n(Perum Chorru Udiyan Cheralathan\n, Athan I\n), or Udiyanjeral (AD first century.\n) is the first recorded Chera dynasty\nruler of the Sangam period\nin ancient South India\n.[1]\n\n[2]\n\nHe had his capital at a place called Kuzhumur in Kuttanad (central Kerala\n) and expanded the kingdom northward and eastward from his original homeland. His lifetime is broadly determined to be between first century BC and 2nd century AD.His queen was Veliyan Nallini, the daughter of Veliyan Venman. Uthiyan Cheralathan\nwas a contemporary of the Chola ruler Karikala Chola\n. He is praised for his elephant corps and cavalry. Present day Changanacherry end of Kuttanad was the capital of the Chera\ndynasty king Uthiyan_Cheralathan\n.His descendant was Senguttavan\n(Chenguttavan means \"brave-hearted\" in malayalam\nand his name is carried by the next towns of Chenganacherri\nand Chengana\nto the present day). According to sangam literature, Cheralathan\nwas defeated in the Battle of Venni\nwith Karikala Chola\nand the capital was burnt down . Another local legend says Kuttanad was believed to be forest with dense tree growth. This forest was destroyed subsequently by a wild fire.","It is a well known fact that burned black wooden logs were mined from paddy fields called as ‘Karinilam’(Black paddy fields) until the recent past. This fact throws some light on this theory of Chuttanad evolving to Kuttanad. In Kuttanad most of the place names end in kari (meaning burnt residue or charcoal). Some familiar place names are Ramankary, Puthukkary, Amichakary, Oorukkary, Mithrakary, Mampuzhakary, Kainakary\n, Kandanakary\n, Thayamkary, Chathurthiakary and Chennamkary\n.","The Kuttanad region is categorised into:","Lower Kuttanadu comprises taluks of Ambalapuzha\ntaluk, Kuttanadu (excluding Edathua\n, Thalavady\nand Muttar\n, and the northern half of Karthikapally\ntaluk in Alappuzha district\n).","Upper Kuttanad comprises Veeyapuram\nand Pallippad\nin Karthikapally\ntaluk, Edathua\n, Thalavady\n, Kidangara\nand Muttar\nin Kuttanad taluk\n; Chennithala\nvillage in Mavelikkara\n, Mannar\n, Kuruttissery\n, Budhanur\n, Ennakkad\nvillages in Chengannur taluk\nof Alappuzha district\n; and Parumala\n, Kadapra\n, Niranam\n, Pulikeezhu\n, Peringara\n, Chathenkeri\n, Nedumpuram\n, villages of Thiruvalla\nin Pathanamthitta district\n.","North Kuttanad comprises Vaikom\ntaluk, western parts of Kottayam\ntaluk, and western parts of Changanacherry\ntaluk in Kottayam district\n.","A few of the major villages which form Kuttanad are: Kainakary\n, Ramankary\n, Puthukkary, Chennamkary\n, Nedumudi\n, Niranam\n, Kaipuzha\n, Kumarakom\n, Edathua\n, Mampuzhakkary\n, Neelamperoor\n, Kainady\n, Kavalam\n, Pulincunnoo\n, Manalady\n, Kannady\nKayalpuram, Veliyanadu\n, Veeyapuram, Vezhapra, Kunnamkary\n, Kumaramkary\n, Valady\n, Kidangara\n, Mithrakary\n, Muttar\n, Neerattupuram\n, Thalavadi\n, Changankary\n, Champakulam\n, Nedumudi\n, Moonnatummukham\n, Melpadom\n, Pulincunnu\n, Pallippad\n","Payippad\n, Karichal\n, Ayaparambu\n, Anary\n, Vellamkulangara\n, Pilappuzha\n, Pandi\n, Edathua\n, Pacha\n, Chekkidikad\n, Thakazhy\n, Cheruthana\n, Karuvatta\n, Chennithala\n, Narakathara\n, Venattukad\n, Kayalppuram\n, Mankompu\n, Chathurthiakary\n, Koduppunna\n, Oorukkary\n, Thayankary\n, Thiruvarpu\n, Pullangadi\nand payattupakka\n, Kandankary\namong others.","The major occupation in Kuttanadu is farming, with rice the most important agricultural product. This activity gives the area its moniker of \"The Rice Bowl of Kerala\". Three crops are grown every year now instead of the traditional practice of two crops per year. Large farming areas near Vembanad Lake\nwere reclaimed from the lake. The history of paddy cultivation in Kuttanad can be traced back centuries. The evolution of paddy cultivation correlated with technological advancement and changes in the regulatory framework that existed during the 19th and 20th centuries. In earlier times, reclamation was carried out mainly from the shallow part of the Vembanad Lake or from the periphery of the Pamba River\n. These reclamations constituted small areas of paddy fields called padsekharams\n. Bailing out of water from the fields were done manually using water wheels called chakram\n. Gradually the manual method used for bailing out of water gave way to steam engines.","There were robberies in Kuttanad in earlier days, which were prohibited by the Travancore Maharajah Moolam Thirunal\n.","Three distinct stages can be identified in the reclamation of kayal lands from the lake. The first stage was carried out by private entrepreneurs without any financial support from the government. The Pattom Proclamation made by the Travencore Kingdom in 1865, gave a great fillip to reclamation activities between 1865 and 1888. During this period de-watering of the polders was done manually using chakram\n, which restricted large-scale reclamation. Only about 250 hectares of land were reclaimed during this period. Venadu kayal and Madathil Kayal were reclaimed during this period and are considered the first \"Kayal Nilams\" to be reclaimed from the Vembanad Lake.[3]\n\nThese pioneering reclamation activities in kayal cultivation were made by the two brothers Mathai Luka Pallithanam and Ouseph Luka Pallithanam from Kainady village in Kuttanadu.[4]\n\n","The second phase started during 1888. One of the reclamation during this period was undertaken by Chalayil Eravi Kesava Panicker. He chose to reclaim Vembanad kayal from the mouth of the Chennamkari river as it joins with the back waters. The reclaimed kayal was known as ‘ Attumuttu Kayal’. Other major reclamation on the same year was Seminary Kayal which was undertaken by Kottayam Orthodox Seminary.","The introduction of kerosene engines for dewatering resulted in the reclamation of wider areas of the lake for cultivation. This made farmers consider venturing into the deeper parts of the lake. During the period between 1898 and 1903, reclamation activity was led by Pallithanam Luka Mathai\n(alias Pallithanathu Mathaichen) who reclaimed the Cherukara Kayal\nand Pallithanam Moovayiram Kayal. But the second phase (1890 to 1903) of reclamation activities came to a halt because of the ban on kayal reclamation imposed by the Madras Government in 1903. Cherukali Kayal, Rajapuram Kayal, Aarupanku Kayal, Pantharndu Panku kayal and Mathi Kayal were the other major reclamations during this period.","In 1912, the Madras Government approved a proposal from the Travancore Government for further reclamations in three stages. Under this scheme kayal land was notified for reclamation in blocks each named with a letter of the English alphabet. Out of the total area of 19,500 acres of kayal land, 12,000 acres were reclaimed between 1913 and 1920. After the removal of the ban in 1913, Pallithanam Luca Matthai\nalong with some other prominent families in Kuttanadu, reclaimed E-Block Kayal measuring a total area 2,400 acres. This is the biggest kayal nilam in Kuttanadu. C.J. Kurian, Ex MLC and Mr. John Illikalam were his main partners in this venture. The reclamations between 1914 and 1920, known as the new reclamations, were carried out in three periods. In the first period Blocks A to G measuring an 6300 Acres were reclaimed. C Block, D Block(Attumukham Aarayiram (Attumuttu Kayal), Thekke Aarayiram and Vadakke Aarayiram) and E Block (Erupathinalayiram Kayal) F Block (Judge's Aarayiram Kayal) and G Block (Kochu Kayal) are the major Kayal nilams reclaimed during this period.","During the second period of new reclamation, blocks H to N covering an area of 3600 acres were reclaimed under the leadership of Pallithanam Luca Matthai\n, Cunnumpurathu Kurien, Vachaparampil Mathen, Pazhayaparmpil Chacko, Kunnathusseril Peious, Ettuparayil Xavier and Pattassery PP Mathai. During the third period of new reclamation, R Block Kayal covering 1,400 acres was reclaimed by the joint efforts of eight families led by then member of Sree Moolam Popular Assembly, Pallithanam Luca Matthai\n. His partners in the reclamation included Vachaparampil Mathen, Pazhayaparmpil Chacko, Ettuparayil Xavier, Pattassery PP Mathai, Meledom, Paruthickal and Kandakudy.","From 1920 to 1940 reclamation activity came to a halt because of a steep drop in the price of rice.","Pallithanam Luca Matthai\n, who had served as member of Maharajah Moolam Thirunal's Praja Sabha\n(Popular Assembly) was considered as the pioneer of cooperative agricultural movement in Kuttanadu. His life marked the beginning of the epoch of first generation Kayal Raja\n's of Kuttanad (Kayal Raja is the term generally used to refer to the prominent kayal cultivators in the Kuttanadu region). In 1931, in order to strengthen the farming community in Kuttanadu, he founded Kuttandu Karshaka Sangham\n(Kuttanadu Agricultural Association\n). From the beginning of his farming career in his teens (he was eighteen when he reclaimed the cherukara kayal), he brought together like minded people and successfully led the reclamation activity from 1898 to 1940.","Due to the steep decline in the price of rice between 1920 and 1940 reclamation activities slowed down, but they gained momentum again in the early 1940s. During this period, in order to increase agricultural output, a government initiated \"Grow More Food\" campaiagn and the provision of incentives encouraged new reclamations. The advent of electric motors made reclamation relatively easier, cheaper and less risky as compared to in earlier periods. The last tract of the reclamations namely Q, S and T block were made during this period by Thomman Joseph Murickummoottil (Muricken Outhachan).","The prominent families in Kuttanadu who were involved in the backwater paddy cultivation are Pallithanam, Pallivathukal, Vallickadu, Pattassery, Nilavumthara - Thattacherry, Vachaparambil, Pazhayaparmbil, Thottukadavil, Chalayil, Chirayil, Vettathu, Cunnumpurathu, Illikalam, Akkara, Nilavumthara - Moolecherry, Ettuparayil, Mangalapallil, Paruthickal, Meledom, Murukkummootil, Kunnathusseril, Ottaveetil, Kottarathil etc.","As farming in the area increased, farmers felt themselves constrained by the two cycles a year for rice cultivation. The reason for which is the limited availability of potable water in Kuttanadu. During the monsoon seasons, the water from the mountains flow through the rivers to the sea, bringing potable water to Kuttanadu. But during summer, due to the low level of the region seawater enters Kuttanadu, significantly increasing the salinity of the water and making it unpotable.","Also Kuttanad is recognised as a Globally Important Agricultural Heritage Systems (GIAHS) by FAO\n","This project was designed as a permanent solution to the flood situation in Kuttanad. This programme was envisaged in such a way that flood waters from Pamba, Manimalayar and Achankovil were diverted to the sea before it reached Vembanad lake. The construction of the Spillway ended by 1959.","In 1968, the Government of India proposed that a bund (Dam\n) be made across the river so that seawater would not be allowed to come inside Kuttanad during summer, allowing farmers to cultivate an extra crop per year. The project was planned in three phases, the south side, the north side and another phase to join the two sections. The project was delayed and by the time the first two phases were complete the entire money allotted for the project ran out and left the final phase in limbo. The farmers who were expecting lots of financial benefits after the completion of the project decided to take matters into their own hands and one night in 1972, a large group of farmers filled the gap between the north and the south side with earth. To this day, the earth embankment between the two sections of the bund remains. With this, it was possible to close the regulator of shutters during December–June when the saline water enters, and then open it during monsoon. Once the Thanneermukkam bund and spillway became operational two crops were possible in Kuttanad.that are chambavu and karutha charu.","Even though the bund has improved the quality of life of the farmers, the bund is alleged to have caused severe environmental problems. The backwaters which were abundant with fish and part of the staple food of the people of the region require a small amount of salt water for its breeding. The bund has caused deterioration of fish varieties in the region and the fishermen opposed to the bund as of 2005. The bund has also disrupted the harmony of the sea with the backwaters and has caused problems not foreseen before the bund like the omniprescence of the water weeds. Earlier the salt water tends to cleanse the backwaters but this does not happen any more leading to the pollution of the backwaters and the entire land near by.","Kuttanad assembly constituency was a part of Alappuzha\n. After the Lok Sabha\ndelimitation in 2008, it now belongs to the Mavelikkara\nconstituency.[5]\n\n"]},"downloaded":true},"d10":{"_id":{"$oid":"5a86b1ad0262df3c25390fc4"},"title":"/wiki/Kovalam","content":{"title":"Kovalam","rels":["/wiki/Kollam_Beach","/wiki/Varkala_Beach","/wiki/Sangam_period","/wiki/Edakkal_Caves","/wiki/Ariyannur_Umbrellas","/wiki/Kudakkallu_Parambu","/wiki/Chovvanur_burial_cave","/wiki/Chera_dynasty","/wiki/Venad","/wiki/Kerala_school_of_astronomy_and_mathematics","/wiki/Battle_of_Colachel","/wiki/Anglo-Mysore_Wars","/wiki/Battle_of_Quilon","/wiki/Vaikom_Satyagraham","/wiki/Cochin_Royal_Family","/wiki/Malabar_Migration","/wiki/List_of_Kerala_State_Government_Organizations","/wiki/List_of_Chief_Ministers_of_Kerala","/wiki/List_of_Governors_of_Kerala","/wiki/Kerala_Legislative_Assembly","/wiki/Local_Body_Election_in_Kerala","/wiki/Saptakakshi_Munnani","/wiki/United_Front_(Kerala)","/wiki/Left_Democratic_Front_(Kerala)","/wiki/United_Democratic_Front_(Kerala)","/wiki/List_of_politicians_of_Kerala","/wiki/Agasthyamala_Biosphere_Reserve","/wiki/Ashtamudi_Lake","/wiki/Kerala_Backwaters","/wiki/Districts_of_Kerala","/wiki/Eravikulam_National_Park","/wiki/Flora_and_fauna_of_Kerala","/wiki/Malabar_Coast","/wiki/Marayoor","/wiki/Nelliampathi","/wiki/Nilgiri_Biosphere_Reserve","/wiki/Nilgiris_(mountains)","/wiki/Palakkad_Gap","/wiki/Protected_areas_of_Kerala","/wiki/Vembanad_Lake","/wiki/Malayali","/wiki/Namboothiri_Brahmin","/wiki/Ambalavasi","/wiki/Samanta_Kshatriya","/wiki/Nair","/wiki/Saint_Thomas_Christians","/wiki/Kerala_Iyers","/wiki/Ezhava","/wiki/Cochin_Jews","/wiki/Jainism_in_Kerala","/wiki/Pulayar","/wiki/Dravidian_people","/wiki/Muslim_Mappila","/wiki/Adivasi","/wiki/List_of_Scheduled_Tribes_in_India#Kerala","/wiki/Kerala_model","/wiki/Tourism_in_Kerala","/wiki/Education_in_Kerala","/wiki/Colleges_in_Kerala","/wiki/Arts_of_Kerala","/wiki/Architecture_of_Kerala","/wiki/Cuisine_of_Kerala","/wiki/Kalarippayattu","/wiki/Malayalam_literature","/wiki/Sarpam_Thullal","/wiki/Triumvirate_poets_of_modern_Malayalam","/wiki/Vallam_Kali","/wiki/Kathakali","/wiki/Kolkali","/wiki/Koodiyattam","/wiki/Mohiniyattam","/wiki/Margamkali","/wiki/Ottamthullal","/wiki/Theyyam","/wiki/Malayalam_cinema","/wiki/Vishu","/wiki/Onam","/wiki/Pooram","/wiki/Malayalam","/wiki/Malayalam_calendar","/wiki/Mappila_dialect_of_Malayalam","/wiki/Suriyani_Malayalam","/wiki/Judeo-Malayalam","/wiki/Irula_language","/wiki/Chenda","/wiki/Thayambaka","/wiki/Kolkali","/wiki/Panchari_melam","/wiki/Panchavadyam","/wiki/Sopanam","/wiki/Nair_Service_Society","/wiki/SNDP","/wiki/Alappuzha#Commerce_and_tourism","/wiki/Athirappilly_Falls","/wiki/Beaches_in_Kerala","/wiki/Bekal","/wiki/Kerala_Backwaters","/wiki/Kollam#Tourism.2C_Places_of_interest_and_historical_significance","/wiki/Islands_of_Kollam","Undefined

a beach\ntown by the Arabian Sea\nin Thiruvananthapuram\n, Kerala\n, India\n, located around 18\u0026#160;km south of the city center.[1]\n\n","","","Kovalam means a grove of coconut trees and true to its name the village offers an endless sight of coconut trees.","Kovalam first received attention when the Regent Maharani Sethu Lakshmi Bayi\nof Travancore\nconstructed her beach resort, Halcyon Castle\n, here towards the end of the 1920s. Thereafter the place was brought to the public eye by her nephew the Maharaja of Travancore\n.[2]\n\nThe European guests of the then Travancore kingdom discovered the potentiality of Kovalam beach as a tourist destination in the 1930s. However, Kovalam shot into limelight in the early seventies with arrivals of the masses of hippies\non their way to Ceylon\nin the Hippie Trail\n. This exodus started the transformation of a casual fishing village of Kerala into one of the most important tourist destinations in all India.[3]\n\n","Kovalam has three beaches separated by rocky outcroppings in its 17\u0026#160;km coastline, the three together form the famous crescent of the Kovalam beach.[4]\n\n","Detour past Kovalam junction to land on Samudra Beach which is to the north of Ashoka Beach. One has the option to walk along the sea-wall too.The sight of the waves lashing on the rocks below is awesome.","Shallow waters stretching for hundreds of metres are ideal for swimming. The beaches have steep palm covered headlands and are lined with shops that offer all kinds of goods and services.[7]\n\n","The larger of the beaches is called Lighthouse Beach for its 35 metre high light house which towers over it atop Kurumkal hillock. The second largest one is Hawah Beach named thus for the topless European women who used to throng there. It was the first topless beach in India.[citation needed\n\n\n]\nHowever topless bathing is banned now except in private coves owned by resorts. Visitors frequent these two beaches. The northern part of the beach is known as Samudra Beach in tourism parlance. A large promontory separates this part from the southern side. Samudra Beach doesn't have tourists thronging there or hectic business. The local fishermen ply their trade on this part. The sands on the beaches in Kovalam are partially black in colour due to the presence of ilmenite\nand Monazite\n. The normal tourist season is from September to May. Ashoka beach is also the part of Kovalam beach.","There are a large number of beach resorts in and around Kovalam.

This village is almost at the southern tip of Trivandrum\nwhile the next village, Pozhiyoor\n, marks the end of Kerala. This village beach attracts tourists.","","","Poovar lies very close to Vizhinjam\n, a natural harbor. Poovar has an estuary which connects with the sea during high tides. The 56\u0026#160;km Neyyar River\npasses through Neyyattinkara taluk into the Arabian Sea\nnear Poovar.[1]\n\nIts natural environment enables it to be a tourist spot.[citation needed\n\n\n]\n","Poovar was a trading center of timber, sandalwood, ivory\nand spices. In around 1,000 BCE, it is believed that ships owned by King Solomon\nof Israel landed in Ophir, which is identified by some sources as Poovar,[2]\n\n[3]\n\nwhile the village was one of the ancient Muslim settlements along the western coast of India. The central mosque in Poovar was built by Malik Deenar\n, an eighth century Muslim preacher. During the reign of the Chola dynasty\n, Poovar was a major port. The explorer Megasthenes\n, Roman writer Pliny the Elder\nand Venetian traveller Marco Polo\nmention connections with Greece\nand Rome\n.[3]\n\n","There were a merchant named Pokku Moosa Maraikkar who lived in Poovar during the 18th century in a house called Kallaraickal Tharavad, which many times gave shelter to Marthanda Varma\n(1706–58), king of Travancore\nfrom his enemies. Poovar also had trade relations with international markets at this time as well as a well trained army and some ships. At the Battle of Colachel\nand Battle of Kayamkulam\nthese forces assisted the Travancore army against the Dutch East India Company\nduring the Travancore–Dutch War\n.","The origin of the name \"Poovar\" has a story related to Marthanda Varma. Before that it was called Pokkumoosapuram. During internal riots in Travancore and while escaping from the Ettuveetil Pillamar\n(Lords of the Eight Houses), the king reached Poovar. It was a spring season and the trees on either sides of the Neyyar\nwere full of flowers. These flowers fell into the river making it more attractive. On seeing this pleasant scenery, Marthanda Varma commented that this was poo-var\n, a conjunction of the Malayalam\nwords for \"flower\" and \"river\".[4]\n\n","Nearest Airport\u0026#160;: Trivandrum

The site and community who maintained it were also known as the Open Directory Project\n(ODP\n). It was owned by AOL\n(now a part of Verizon\n's Oath Inc.\n) but constructed and maintained by a community\nof volunteer editors.","DMOZ used a hierarchical ontology\nscheme for organizing site listings. Listings on a similar topic were grouped into categories which then included smaller categories.","DMOZ closed on March 17, 2017 because AOL no longer wished to support the project.[2]\n\n[3]\n\nThe website became a single landing page on that day, with links to a static archive of DMOZ, and to the DMOZ discussion forum, where plans to rebrand and relaunch the directory are being discussed.[3]\n\n","As of September\u0026#160;2017[update]\n\n, a non-editable mirror remained available at dmoztools.net,[4]\n\nand it was stated that while the DMOZ URL would not return, a successor version of the directory would, at Curlie.org.[5]\n\n[6]\n\n","","","DMOZ was founded in the United States as Gnuhoo\nby Rich Skrenta\nand Bob Truel\nin 1998 while they were both working as engineers for Sun Microsystems\n. Chris Tolles, who worked at Sun Microsystems as the head of marketing for network security products, also signed on in 1998 as a co-founder of Gnuhoo along with co-founders Bryn Dole and Jeremy Wenokur. Skrenta had developed TASS\n, an ancestor of tin\n, the popular threaded Usenet\nnewsreader for Unix\nsystems. The original category structure of the Gnuhoo directory was based loosely on the structure of Usenet newsgroups then in existence.","The Gnuhoo directory went live on June 5, 1998. After a Slashdot\n\narticle suggested that Gnuhoo had nothing in common with the spirit of free software\n,[7]\n\nfor which the GNU\nproject was known, Richard Stallman and the Free Software Foundation\nobjected to the use of \"Gnu\" in the name and Gnuhoo was changed to NewHoo. Yahoo!\nthen objected to the use of \"Hoo\" in the name, prompting a proposed name change, to ZURL.[8]\n\nPrior to switching to ZURL, NewHoo was acquired by Netscape Communications Corporation\nin October 1998 and became the Open Directory Project. Netscape released Open Directory data under the Open Directory License\n. Netscape was acquired by AOL\nshortly thereafter and DMOZ was one of the assets included in the acquisition.","By the time Netscape assumed stewardship, the Open Directory Project had about 100,000 URLs\nindexed with contributions from about 4500 editors. On October 5, 1999, the number of URLs indexed by DMOZ reached one million. According to an unofficial estimate, the URLs in DMOZ numbered 1.6 million in April 2000, surpassing those in the Yahoo! Directory\n.[9]\n\nDMOZ achieved the milestones of indexing two million URLs on August 14, 2000, three million listings on November 18, 2001 and four million on December 3, 2003. As of April 2013 there were 5,169,995 sites listed in over 1,017,500 categories. On October 31, 2015, there were 3,996,412 sites listed in 1,026,706 categories.","In January 2006, DMOZ began publishing online reports to inform the public about the development of the project. The first report covered the year 2005. Monthly reports were issued subsequently until September 2006.[10]\n\nThese reports gave greater insight into the functioning of the directory than the simplified statistics provided on the front page of the directory. The number of listings and categories cited on the front page included \"Test\" and \"Bookmarks\" categories but these were not included in the RDF dump offered to users. There were about 7330 active editors during August 2006.[10]\n\n75,151 editors had contributed to the directory as of March 31, 2007.[11]\n\nAs of April 2013, the number of contributing editors had increased to 97,584.[11]\n\n","On October 20, 2006, DMOZ's main server suffered a catastrophic failure\n[12]\n\nthat prevented editors from working on the directory until December 18, 2006. During that period, an older build of the directory was visible to the public. On January 13, 2007, the Site Suggestion and Update Listings forms were again made available.[13]\n\nOn January 26, 2007, weekly publication of RDF dumps resumed. To avoid future outages, the system resided on a redundant configuration of two Intel-based servers from then on.[14]\n\n","The site's interface was given an upgrade in 2016, branded \"DMOZ 3.0\" but AOL took it offline the following year.","As DMOZ became more widely known, two other major web directories\nedited by volunteers and sponsored by Go.com\nand Zeal\nemerged, both now defunct. These directories did not license their content for open content\ndistribution.[15]\n\n[16]\n\n","The concept of using a large-scale community of editors to compile online content has been successfully applied to other types of projects. DMOZ's editing model directly inspired at least three other open content volunteer projects: music site MusicMoz, an open content restaurant directory known as ChefMoz\n[17]\n\nand an encyclopedia known as Open Site\n.[18]\n\nFinally, according to Larry Sanger\n, DMOZ was part of the inspiration for the Nupedia\nproject, out of which Wikipedia\ngrew.[19]\n\n","Original logo as from June 1998","Logo after rebranding as NewHoo\n","Logo after acquisition by Netscape","Logo from 1999 to 2014 with the name DMOZ\n","Logo from March 2014","Logo from June 2016 until the closing in March 2017","Gnuhoo borrowed the basic outline for its initial ontology from Usenet\n. In 1998, Rich Skrenta said, \"I took a long list of groups and hand-edited them into a hierarchy.\"[20]\n\nFor example, the topic covered by the comp.ai.alife newsgroup was represented by the category Computers/AI/Artificial_Life. The original divisions were for Adult\n, Arts\n, Business\n, Computers\n, Games\n, Health\n, Home\n, News\n, Recreation\n, Reference\n, Regional\n, Science\n, Shopping\n, Society\n, Sports\nand \"World\". While these sixteen top-level\ncategories have remained intact, the ontology of second- and lower-level categories has undergone a gradual evolution; significant changes are initiated by discussion among editors and then implemented when consensus has been reached.","In July 1998, the directory became multilingual\nwith the addition of the World\ntop-level category. The remainder of the directory lists only English language sites. By May 2005, seventy-five languages were represented. The growth rate of the non-English components of the directory has been greater than the English component since 2002. While the English component of the directory held almost 75% of the sites in 2003, the World\nlevel grew to over 1.5 million sites as of May 2005, forming roughly one-third of the directory. The ontology in non-English categories generally mirrors that of the English directory, although exceptions which reflect language differences are quite common.","Several of the top-level categories have unique characteristics. The Adult\ncategory is not present on the directory homepage but it is fully available in the RDF dump that DMOZ provides. While the bulk of the directory is categorized primarily by topic, the Regional category is categorized primarily by region. This has led many to view DMOZ as two parallel directories: Regional\nand Topical\n.","On November 14, 2000, a special directory within DMOZ was created for people under 18 years of age.[21]\n\nKey factors distinguishing this \"Kids and Teens\" area from the main directory are:","By May 2005, this portion of DMOZ included over 32,000 site listings.","Since early 2004, the whole site has been in UTF-8\nencoding. Prior to this, the encoding used to be ISO 8859-1\nfor English language categories and a language-dependent character set for other languages. The RDF dumps have been encoded in UTF-8 since early 2000.","Directory listings are maintained by editors. While some editors focus on the addition of new listings, others focus on maintaining the existing listings and some do both. This includes tasks such as the editing of individual listings to correct spelling and/or grammatical errors, as well as monitoring the status of linked sites. Still others go through site submissions to remove spam and duplicate submissions.","Robozilla is a Web crawler\nwritten to check the status of all sites listed in DMOZ. Periodically, Robozilla will flag sites which appear to have moved or disappeared and editors follow up to check the sites and take action. This process is critical for the directory in striving to achieve one of its founding goals: to reduce the link rot\nin web directories. Shortly after each run, the sites marked with errors are automatically moved to the unreviewed queue where editors may investigate them when time permits.","Due to the popularity of DMOZ and its resulting impact on search engine\nrankings (See PageRank\n), domains with lapsed registration that are listed on DMOZ have attracted domain hijacking\n, an issue that has been addressed by regularly removing expired domains from the directory.","While corporate funding and staff for DMOZ have diminished in recent years, volunteers have created editing tools such as linkcheckers to supplement Robozilla, category crawlers, spellcheckers, search tools that directly sift a recent RDF dump, bookmarklets\nto help automate some editing functions, mozilla based add-ons,[23]\n\nand tools to help work through unreviewed queues.","DMOZ data was previously made available under the terms of the Open Directory License\n, which required a specific DMOZ attribution table on every Web page that uses the data.","The Open Directory License also included a requirement that users of the data continually check DMOZ site for updates and discontinue use and distribution of the data or works derived from the data once an update occurs. This restriction prompted the Free Software Foundation\nto refer to the Open Directory License\nas a non-free documentation license, citing the right to redistribute a given version not being permanent and the requirement to check for changes to the license.","In 2011, DMOZ silently changed its license to a Creative Commons\nAttribution license[citation needed\n\n\n]\n, which is compatible with the FSF.[24]\n\n","DMOZ data is made available through an RDF-like dump that is published on a download server, older versions are also archived there.[25]\n\nNew versions are usually generated weekly. An DMOZ editor has catalogued a number of bugs that are encountered in the DMOZ RDF dump, most importantly that the file format isn't RDF.[26]\n\nSo while today the so-called RDF dump is valid XML\n, it is not valid RDF\nand as such, software to process the DMOZ RDF dump needs to be specifically written for DMOZ data.","DMOZ data powers the core directory services\nfor many of the Web's largest search engines and portals, including Netscape Search, AOL Search, and Alexa\n. Google Directory\nused DMOZ information, until being shuttered in July 2011.[27]\n\n","Other uses are also made of DMOZ data. For example, in the spring of 2004 Overture\nannounced a search service for third parties combining Yahoo! Directory search results with DMOZ titles, descriptions and category metadata. The search engine Gigablast announced on May 12, 2005 its searchable copy of DMOZ. The technology permits search of websites listed in specific categories, \"in effect, instantly creating over 500,000 vertical search engines\".[28]\n\n","As of 8\u0026#160;September\u0026#160;2006[update]\n\n, DMOZ listed 313 English-language Web sites that use DMOZ data as well as 238 sites in other languages.[29]\n\nHowever, these figures do not reflect the full picture of use, as those sites that use DMOZ data without following the terms of the DMOZ license are not listed.","Restrictions are imposed on who can become an DMOZ editor. The primary gatekeeping mechanism is an editor application process wherein editor candidates demonstrate their editing abilities, disclose affiliations that might pose a conflict of interest\n, and otherwise give a sense of how the applicant would likely mesh with the DMOZ culture and mission.[30]\n\nA majority of applications are rejected but reapplying is allowed and sometimes encouraged. The same standards apply to editors of all categories and subcategories.[citation needed\n\n\n]\n","DMOZ's editing model is a hierarchical\none. Upon becoming editors, individuals will generally have editing permissions in only a small category. Once they have demonstrated basic editing skills in compliance with the Editing Guidelines, they are welcome to apply for additional editing privileges in either a broader category or else another category in the directory. Mentorship relationships between editors are encouraged, and internal forums provide a vehicle for new editors to ask questions.[citation needed\n\n\n]\n","DMOZ has its own internal forums, the contents of which are intended only for editors to communicate with each other primarily about editing topics. Access to the forums requires an editor account and editors are expected to keep the contents of these forums private.[31]\n\n","Over time, senior editors can be granted additional privileges which reflect their editing experience and leadership within the editing community. The most straightforward are editall\nprivileges, which allow an editor to access all categories in the directory. Meta\nprivileges additionally allow editors to perform tasks such as reviewing editor applications, setting category features, and handling external and internal abuse reports. Cateditall\nprivileges are similar to editall\n, but only for a single directory category. Similarly, catmod\nprivileges are similar to meta\n, but only for a single directory category. Catmv\nprivileges allow editors to make changes to directory ontology by moving or renaming categories. All of these privileges are granted by admins and staff, usually after discussion with meta\neditors.[citation needed\n\n\n]\n","In August 2004, a new level of privileges called admin\nwas introduced. Administrator status was granted to a number of long serving metas by staff. Administrators have the ability to grant editall+ privileges to other editors and to approve new directory-wide policies, powers which had previously only been available to root (staff) editors.[32]\n\n","All DMOZ editors are expected to abide by DMOZ's Editing Guidelines. These guidelines describe editing basics: which types of sites may be listed and which may not; how site listings should be titled and described in a loosely consistent manner; conventions for the naming and building of categories; conflict of interest limitations on the editing of sites which the editor may own or otherwise be affiliated with; and a code of conduct within the community.[33]\n\nEditors who are found to have violated these guidelines may be contacted by staff or senior editors, have their editing permissions cut back, or lose their editing privileges entirely. DMOZ Guidelines are periodically revised after discussion in editor forums.[citation needed\n\n\n]\n","There have long been allegations that volunteer DMOZ editors give favorable treatment to their own websites while concomitantly thwarting the good faith efforts of their competition.[34]\n\nSuch allegations are fielded by ODP's staff and meta editors, who have the authority to take disciplinary action against volunteer editors who are suspected of engaging in abusive editing practices.[35]\n\nIn 2003, DMOZ introduced a new Public Abuse Report System\nthat allows members of the general public to report and track allegations of abusive editor conduct using an online form.[36]\n\nUninhibited discussion of DMOZ's purported shortcomings has become more common on mainstream Webmaster discussion forums. Although site policies suggest that an individual site should be submitted to only one category,[37]\n\nas of October 2007, Topix.com, a news aggregation site operated by DMOZ founder Rich Skrenta, had more than 17,000 listings.[38]\n\n","Early in the history of DMOZ, its staff gave representatives of selected companies, such as Rolling Stone\n\nor CNN\n, editing access in order to list individual pages from their websites.[39]\n\nLinks to individual CNN articles were added until 2004, but were entirely removed from the directory in January 2008[40]\n\ndue to the content being outdated and not considered worth the effort to maintain. There have been no similar experiments with the editing policy since then.","Underlying some controversy surrounding DMOZ is its ownership and management. Some of the original GnuHoo volunteers felt that they had been deceived into joining a commercial enterprise.[7]\n\nTo varying degrees, those complaints have continued up until the present.","At DMOZ's inception, there was little thought given to the idea of how DMOZ should be managed and there were no official forums\n, guidelines or FAQs\n. In essence, DMOZ began as a free for all.[41]\n\n","As time went on, the ODP Editor Forums became the de facto\nDMOZ parliament and when one of DMOZ's staff members would post an opinion in the forums, it would be considered an official ruling.[31]\n\nEven so, DMOZ staff began to give trusted senior editors additional editing privileges, including the ability to approve new editor applications, which eventually led to a stratified hierarchy of duties and privileges among DMOZ editors, with DMOZ's paid staff having the final say regarding DMOZ's policies and procedures.[32]\n\n[42]\n\n","Robert Keating, a principal of Touchstone Consulting Group in Washington, D.C. since 2006, has worked as AOL's Program Manager for DMOZ since 2004. He started working for AOL in 1999 as Senior Editor for AOL Search, then as Managing Editor, AOL Search, DMOZ, and then as Media Ecosystem Manager, AOL Product Marketing.[43]\n\n[44]\n\n","DMOZ's editor removal procedures are overseen by DMOZ's staff and meta editors. According to DMOZ's official editorial guidelines, editors are removed for abusive editing practices or uncivil behaviour. Discussions that may result in disciplinary action against volunteer editors take place in a private forum which can only be accessed by DMOZ's staff and meta editors. Volunteer editors who are being discussed are not given notice that such proceedings are taking place.[42]\n\nSome people find this arrangement distasteful, wanting instead a discussion modelled more like a trial held in the U.S. judicial system.[45]\n\n","In the article \"Editor Removal Explained\", DMOZ meta editor Arlarson states that \"a great deal of confusion about the removal of editors from DMOZ results from false or misleading statements by former editors\".[46]\n\n","The DMOZ's confidentiality guidelines prohibit any current DMOZ editors in a position to know anything from discussing the reasons for specific editor removals.[42]\n\nHowever, a generic list of reasons is for example given in the guidelines.[47]\n\nIn the past, this has led to removed DMOZ editors wondering why they cannot login at DMOZ to perform their editing work.[48]\n\n[49]\n\n","David F. Prenatt, Jr., former DMOZ editor netesq\n, and another former editor known by the alias The Cunctator\n, both claim to have been removed for disagreeing with staff about changes to policies, particularly DMOZ's copyright\npolicies. According to their claims, staff use the excuse of uncivil behaviour as a means to remove bothersome editors.[45]\n\n[50]\n\n[51]\n\n","Senior DMOZ editors have the ability to attach \"warning\" or \"do not list\" notes to individual domains but no editor has the unilateral ability to block certain sites from being listed. Sites with these notes might still be listed and at times notes are removed after some discussion.[52]\n\n","Criticism of DMOZ's hierarchical\nstructure emerged by around 2005. Many believe hierarchical directories are too complicated. With the emergence of Web 2.0\n, folksonomies\nbegan to appear, and some editors proposed that folksonomies, networks\nand directed graphs\nare more \"natural\" and easier to manage than hierarchies.[53]\n\n[54]\n\n[55]\n\n","The ODPSearch software is a derivative version of Isearch\nwhich is open source\n, licensed under the Mozilla Public License\n.[56]\n\n","The ODP Editor Forums were originally run on software that was based on the proprietary Ultimate Bulletin Board\nsystem. In June 2003, they switched to the open source phpBB\nsystem. As of 2007, these forums are powered by a modified version of phpBB.","The bug tracking software used by the ODP is Bugzilla\nand the web server Apache\n. Squid\nweb proxy server was also used but it was removed in August 2007 when the storage servers were reorganized. All these applications are open source.","The DMOZ database/editing software is closed source (although Richard Skrenta has said in June 1998 that he was considering licensing it under the GNU General Public License\n). This has led to criticism from the aforementioned GNU project, many of whom also criticized the DMOZ content license. The content was later released under a Creative Commons license, which is compatible with the GNU license.[57]\n\n","As such, there have been some efforts to provide alternatives to DMOZ. These alternatives would allow communities of like-minded editors to set up and maintain their own open source/open content Web directories. However, no significant open source/open content alternative to DMOZ has emerged."]},"downloaded":true},"d15":{"_id":{"$oid":"5a86b1bc0262df3c25390fc9"},"title":"/wiki/OpenStreetMap","content":{"title":"OpenStreetMap","rels":["/wiki/Manchester","/wiki/Limerick","/wiki/Amsterdam","/wiki/Girona","/wiki/Denver","/wiki/Tokyo","/wiki/Birmingham","/wiki/Buenos_Aires","/wiki/Brussels","/wiki/Aizuwakamatsu","/wiki/Latitude","/wiki/Longitude","/wiki/WGS_84","/wiki/Point_of_interest","/wiki/Polyline","/wiki/Polygon","/wiki/Tag_(metadata)","/wiki/Metadata","/wiki/Ontology_(computer_science)","/wiki/Apple_Inc.","/wiki/IPhoto#iOS_version","/wiki/IOS","/wiki/TomTom","/wiki/Flickr","/wiki/Baghdad","/wiki/Kabul","/wiki/Nokia","/wiki/MapQuest","/wiki/Foursquare","/wiki/Mapbox","/wiki/Craigslist","/wiki/HTML5","/wiki/Hasbro","/wiki/Board_game","/wiki/Monopoly_(game)","/wiki/Monopoly_City_Streets","/wiki/Massively_multiplayer_online_game","/wiki/Moovit","/wiki/TCDD_Ta%C5%9F%C4%B1mac%C4%B1l%C4%B1k","/wiki/YHT","/wiki/Wikivoyage","/wiki/Locator_map","/wiki/Dublin","/wiki/World_of_the_Living_Dead","/wiki/Greater_Los_Angeles_Area","/wiki/Geotab","/wiki/Strava","/wiki/Tableau_Software","/wiki/Niantic_(company)","/wiki/Ingress_(video_game)","/wiki/Pok%C3%A9mon_Go","/wiki/Snapchat","/wiki/Collaborative_mapping","/wiki/Comparison_of_web_map_services","/wiki/Counter-mapping","/wiki/Mapillary","/wiki/Neogeography","/wiki/Turn-by-turn_navigation","/wiki/Volunteered_geographic_information","/wiki/HERE_Map_Creator","/wiki/Google_Map_Maker","/wiki/Wikimapia","/wiki/Yandex_Maps","/wiki/Karta_GPS","/wiki/MAPS.ME","/wiki/International_Standard_Book_Number","/wiki/International_Standard_Book_Number","/wiki/OpenStreetMap_Foundation","/wiki/OpenStreetMap#State_of_the_Map","/wiki/Steve_Coast","/wiki/OpenSeaMap","/wiki/Wheelmap.org","/wiki/Mapbox","/wiki/ID_(software)","/wiki/JOSM","/wiki/Potlatch_(software)","/wiki/Leaflet_(software)","/wiki/Mapnik","/wiki/OpenLayers","/wiki/Maps.me","/wiki/Marble_(software)","/wiki/MoNav","/wiki/Navit","/wiki/OsmAnd","/wiki/Geo-Wiki","/wiki/NASA_World_Wind","/wiki/WikiMapia","/wiki/Bhuvan","/wiki/Apple_Maps","/wiki/Bing_Maps","/wiki/Google_Maps","/wiki/Here_(company)","/wiki/MapQuest","/wiki/Yahoo!_Maps","/wiki/Ordnance_Survey","/wiki/Ordnance_Survey_Ireland","/wiki/Age_of_the_Earth","/wiki/Evolutionary_history_of_life","/wiki/Faint_young_Sun_paradox","/wiki/Formation_and_evolution_of_the_Solar_System","/wiki/Future_of_Earth","/wiki/Geologic_time_scale","/wiki/Geological_history_of_Earth","/wiki/History_of_Earth","/wiki/Timeline_of_evolutionary_history_of_life","/wiki/Continent","/wiki/Earthquake","/wiki/Equatorial_bulge","/wiki/Extremes_on_Earth","/wiki/Geology_of_solar_terrestrial_planets","/wiki/Geophysics","/wiki/Plate_tectonics","/wiki/Structure_of_the_Earth","/wiki/Time_zone","/wiki/Earth_Day","/wiki/Global_warming","/wiki/Human_impact_on_the_environment","/wiki/Apple_Maps","/wiki/Baidu_Maps","/wiki/Bhuvan","/wiki/Bing_Maps","/wiki/Global_Map","/wiki/Google_Earth","/wiki/Google_Maps","/wiki/MapmyIndia","/wiki/NASA_World_Wind","/wiki/Here_(company)","Undefined Attribute","/wiki/Wikimapia","/wiki/Remote_sensing","/wiki/Yahoo!_Maps","/wiki/Yandex","/wiki/Earth_in_culture","/wiki/Earth_in_science_fiction","/wiki/Etymology_of_the_word_%22Earth%22","/wiki/History_of_the_world","/wiki/International_law","/wiki/Landscape_painting","/wiki/List_of_sovereign_states","/wiki/World_economy","/wiki/Biosphere","/wiki/Earth_trojan","/wiki/Ecliptic","/wiki/Flag_of_Earth","/wiki/Gravity_of_Earth","/wiki/Moon","/wiki/Claimed_moons_of_Earth","/wiki/2006_RH120","/wiki/Kordylewski_cloud","/wiki/Solar_System","/wiki/Theia_(planet)","/wiki/Beidou_navigation_system","/wiki/Galileo_(satellite_navigation)","/wiki/GLONASS","/wiki/Global_Positioning_System","/wiki/Quasi-Zenith_Satellite_System","/wiki/Personal_navigation_assistant","/wiki/Automotive_navigation_system","/wiki/GPS_tracking","/wiki/GPS_tracking#Data_loggers","/wiki/SiRFstarIII","/wiki/MediaTek","/wiki/European_Geostationary_Navigation_Overlay_Service","/wiki/Wide_Area_Augmentation_System","/wiki/Multi-functional_Satellite_Augmentation_System","/wiki/NMEA_0183","/wiki/Assisted_GPS","/wiki/S-GPS","/wiki/Bing_Maps","/wiki/Google_Earth","/wiki/Google_Maps","Undefined Attribute","/wiki/NASA_World_Wind","/wiki/ViaMichelin","/wiki/Yahoo!_Maps","/wiki/Geocaching","Undefined Attribute","/wiki/Geographic_information_system","/wiki/Geocoding","/wiki/Geoinformatics","/wiki/Geomatics","/wiki/GPS_wildlife_tracking","/wiki/Virtual_International_Authority_File","/wiki/Library_of_Congress_Control_Number","/wiki/Integrated_Authority_File","/wiki/Biblioth%C3%A8que_nationale_de_France","/wiki/National_Library_of_the_Czech_Republic","/wiki/OpenStreetMap","/wiki/OpenStreetMap"],"contents":["OpenStreetMap\n(OSM\n) is a collaborative project\nto create a free\neditable map\nof the world.

In the UK and elsewhere, government-run and tax-funded projects like the Ordnance Survey\ncreated massive datasets but failed to freely and widely distribute them.

In December 2006, Yahoo!\nconfirmed that OpenStreetMap could use its aerial photography\nas a backdrop for map production.[14]\n\n","In April 2007, Automotive Navigation Data\n(AND) donated a complete road data set for the Netherlands\nand trunk road\ndata for India\nand China to the project[15]\n\nand by July 2007, when the first OSM international The State of the Map conference was held, there were 9,000 registered users.

culture of Kerala\n\nis a synthesis of Aryan\nand Dravidian\ncultures, developed and mixed for centuries, under influences from other parts of India and abroad.[1]\n\n[2]\n\nIt is defined by its antiquity and the organic continuity sustained by the Malayali people\n.[3]\n\nModern Kerala society took shape owing to migrations from different parts of India and abroad throughout Classical Antiquity\n.[2]\n\n[4]\n\n[5]\n\n","Kerala traces its non-prehistoric cultural genesis to its membership (around the AD 3rd century) in a vaguely defined historical region known as Thamizhagom\n— a land defined by a common Tamil culture\nand encompassing the Chera, Chola, and Pandya kingdoms. At that time, the music, dance, language (first Dravida Bhasha\n— \"Dravidian language\"[6]\n\n— then Tamil), and Sangam\n\n(a vast corpus of Tamil literature composed between 1,500–2,000 years ago) found in Kerala were all similar to that found in the rest of Thamizhagom\n(today's Tamil Nadu). The culture of Kerala evolved through the Sanskritization\nof Dravidian ethos, revivalism\nof religious movements and reform movements\nagainst caste discrimination\n.[7]\n\n[8]\n\n[9]\n\nKerala showcases a culture unique to itself developed through accommodation, acculturation and assimilation of various faculties of civilized lifestyle.","","","Native traditions of classical performing arts\ninclude koodiyattom\n\n, a form of Sanskrit\ndrama\nor theatre\nand a UNESCO\n-designated Human Heritage Art. Kathakali (from katerumbu\n(\"story\") and kali\n(\"performance\")) is a 500-year-old form of dance\n-drama\nthat interprets ancient epics; a popularized offshoot of kathakali\nis Kerala natanam\n\n(developed in the 20th century by dancer\nGuru Gopinath\n). Meanwhile, koothu\n\nis a more light-hearted performance mode, akin to modern stand-up comedy\n; an ancient art originally confined to temple sanctuaries, it was later popularized by Mani Madhava Chakyar\n. Other Keralite performing arts include mohiniyaattam\n\n(\"dance of the enchantress\"), which is a type of graceful choreographed\ndance performed by women and accompanied by musical vocalizations. Thullal\n\n, Thirayattam\n\n, padayani\n\n, and theyyam\n\nare other important Keralite performing arts.Thirayattam\nis one of the most outstanding Ethnic art of kerala\n. This vibrant ritualistic annual performing art form enacted in courtyards of \"Kaavukal\"(sacred groves) and village shrine.[10]\n\n","Kerala also has several tribal and folk art forms. For example, Kummattikali\nis the famous colorful mask-dance of South Malabar, performed during the festival of Onam. The Kannyar Kali\ndances (also known as Desathukali) are fast moving, militant dances attuned to rhythmic devotional folk songs and asuravadyas. Also important are various performance genres that are Islam\n- or Christianity-themed. These include oppana\n\n, which is widely popular among Keralite Muslims and is native to Malabar. Oppana\n\nincorporates group dance accompanied by the beat of rhythmic hand clapping and ishal\nvocalizations.","Margam Kali\nis one of the ancient round group dance of Kerala practiced by Saint Thomas Christians\n.[11]\n\n","However, many of these native art forms largely play to tourists or at youth festivals, and are not as popular among ordinary Keralites. Thus, more contemporary forms — including those heavily based on the use of often risqué and politically incorrect\nmimicry\nand parody\n— have gained considerable mass appeal in recent years.[citation needed\n\n\n]\nIndeed, contemporary artists often use such modes to mock socioeconomic elites. In recent decades, Malayalam cinema\n, yet another mode of widely popular artistic expression, have provided a distinct and indigenous Keralite alternative to both Bollywood\nand Hollywood\n.","The ragas\n\nand talas\n\nof lyrical and devotional Carnatic music\n— another native product of South India — dominates Keralite classical musical genres. Swathi Thirunal Rama Varma\n, a 19th-century king of Travancore and patron and composer of music, was instrumental in popularising carnatic music in early Kerala.[12]\n\n[13]\n\nAdditionally, Kerala has its own native music system, sopanam\n, which is a lugubrious and step-by-step rendition of raga-based songs. It is Sopanam\n\n, for example, that provides the background music used in Kathakali\n\n. The wider traditional music of Kerala\nalso includes melam\n\n(including the paandi\nand panchari\nvariants), as style of percussive\nmusic performed at temple\n-centered festivals using an instrument known as the chenda\n\n. Up to 150 musicians may comprise the ensembles staging a given performance; each performance, in turn, may last up to four hours. Panchavadyam\n\nis a differing type of percussion ensemble consisting of five types of percussion instruments; these can be utilised by up to one hundred artists in certain major festivals. In addition to these, percussive music is also associated with various uniquely Keralite folk arts forms. Lastly, the popular music\nof Kerala — as in the rest of India — is dominated by the filmi\n\nmusic of Indian cinema\n. The most remembered name in kerala music culture is of Great Indian musician Sri K. J. Yesudas\n.","Malayalam literature\nis ancient in origin, and includes such figures as the 14th century Niranam poets\n(Madhava Panikkar, Sankara Panikkar and Rama Panikkar), whose works mark the dawn of both modern Malayalam language and indigenous Keralite poetry. The Triumvirate of poets\n(Kavithrayam\n: Kumaran Asan\n, Vallathol Narayana Menon\nand Ulloor S. Parameswara Iyer\n) are recognized for moving keralian poetry away from archaic sophistry\nand metaphysics\nand towards a more lyrical\nmode. Poets like Changampuzha\n, Cherusseri\nand Edappally Raghavan Pillai\nalso contributed to bring Malayalam\npoetry to the common man. Later, such contemporary writers as Booker Prize\nwinner Arundhati Roy\n(whose 1996 semi-autobiographical\nbestseller The God of Small Things\n\nis set in the Kottayam\ntown of Ayemenem) have garnered international recognition. From 1970 to early 1990s, a lot of Malayalam Novelists and story writers contributed to the Literature of Kerala. The contributions from Thakazhi Sivashankara Pillai\n, P. Kesavadev\n, Uroob\n, OV Vijayan\n, T Padmanabhan\n, Sethu\n, Perumbadavam Sreedharan\n, Kovilan\n, M. Mukundan\n, Kakkanadan\n, Anand\nand Paul Zacharia\n, have been remarkable. Significant contributions from poets and songwriters such as Vayalar Rama Varma\n, P. Bhaskaran\nand ONV Kurup\nhave influenced contemporary literature. Critics such as Kuttikrishna Marar\nand M.P. Paul\ntill the sixties and later, M Krishnan Nair\n, S. Gupthan Nair\n, M. K. Sanu\n, Sukumar Azhikode\n, K.P. Appan\n, Narendra Prasad\nand M. Leelavathy\nhave added value by providing critical analysis of the books written during the recent past.","The folklore of Kerala includes elements from the traditional lifestyle of the people of Kerala. The traditional beliefs, customs,rituals etc. are reflected in the folkart and songs of Kerala. Kerala has a rich tradition of Folklore.[14]\n\nFolklore in this region is a spontaneous expression of human behavior and thoughts. Generally speaking, Folklore could be defined as the lore of the common people who had been marginalized during the reign of feudal Kings. The Keralites have their culture and lore which were mostly part of agricultural. Sowing, planting of nharu (seedling), clearing out the weeds, harvests etc. are the different stages of agriculture which have their typical rituals. Numerous songs and performing arts are accompanied with them. Kanyar Kali, Padayani\n, Mudiyettu\n, Thirayattam\n, Malavayiyattam, Theyyam\n, Kothamooriyattam, Nira, Puthari, etc. are some of the ritual folklore of Kerala. It was under the rule of Kolathiris\n, the Kings of Kolathunadu\n, and they codified the rituals, beliefs, taboos and folk performing arts. Even the dates of specific fertility rituals and folk performances were decided by the Kolathiris of which many are continuing even today.The Theyyam\nfestivals, even now, are conducted as per the dates once fixed by the King.","The folk arts of Kerala can be broadly classified under two heads:[15]\n\nritualistic and non-ritualistic. Ritualistic folk arts can be further divided into two: devotional and magical. Devotional folk arts are performed to propitiate a particular God or Goddess. Theyyam\n, thirayattam\n, poothamthira, kanyarkali, kummatti\n, etc., are some of them. Forms like panappattu and thottampattu are composed in the form of songs. In kolkali, margamkali\n, daffumuttukkali\n, etc., the ritualistic element is not very strong. Magical folk arts seek to win general prosperity for a community or exorcise evil spirits or to beget children. Gandharvas\nand nagas\nare worshipped in order to win these favours. The magical folk arts include pambinthullal, pooppadathullal, kolamthullal, malayankettu, etc.","(Malayalam: ???) Onam is a harvest festival celebrated extravagantly by the people of Kerala, India. It is also the state festival of Kerala with State holidays on 4 days starting from Onam Eve (Uthradom) to the 4th Onam Day. Onam Festival falls during the Malayalam\nmonth of Chingam (Aug - Sep) and marks the commemoration of Vamana\navatara of Vishnu and the subsequent homecoming of King Mahabali\n, who Malayalees consider to be just and fair King who was exiled to the underworld. Onam is reminiscent of Kerala's agrarian past, as it is considered to be a harvest festival. It is one of the festivals celebrated with most number of cultural elements. Some of them are Vallam Kali, Pulikkali, Pookkalam, Onatthappan, Thumbi Thullal, Onavillu\n, Kazhchakkula, Onapottan, Atthachamayame etc.","Another distinct feature of the festival is 'Ona Sadhya' (Onam Feast) and consists of numerous dishes served on banana leaf and 'Ona Kodi' (new dress for the special occasion). Usual the Ona Sadhya consist of numerous side dishes along with rice and Ona Kodi is traditional dress. Both are eagerly observed by the youth with excitement.","The people of Kerala are very fond of politics. Majority of keralites belong to either one of the political alliances namely United Democratic Front\n(UDF) or Left Democratic Front\n(LDF). Bharatiya Janatha Party\n(BJP), a national party, also has good following. Regional parties such as Indian Union Muslim League\n(IUML), various factions of Kerala Congress\n, various factions of Revolutionary Socialist Party\nand a host of smaller parties add spice to Kerala political scene. Religious leaders have high influence in Kerala political movements. For many Keralites it's nostalgic to remember the political discussions and debates they had done in the 'chaya kada\n' (local tea shops were youngsters go to sip a cup and read newspapers) in their younger ages.","Being the state with the highest literacy rate and education level in the country, the Kerala society has moved from its agricultural background. Although Kerala remains fairly liberal in its outlook and open to modern ideas,and technological changes, the State largely remains conservative on social issues.","Kerala also has its own indigenous form of martial art\n- Kalarippayattu\n, derived from the words kalari\n\n(\"place\", \"threshing floor\", or \"battlefield\") and payattu\n(\"exercise\" or \"practice\"). Influenced by both Kerala’s Brahminical past and Ayurvedic medicine, kalaripayattu\nis attributed by oral tradition to Parasurama. After some two centuries of suppression by British colonial authorities, it is now experiencing strong comeback among Keralites while also steadily gaining worldwide attention. Other popular ritual arts include theyyam\n\nand poorakkali\n\n— these originate from northern Malabar, which is the northernmost part of Kerala. Nevertheless, these have in modern times been largely supplanted by more popular sports such as cricket\n, kabaddi\n, soccer\n, badminton\n, and others. 'Kochi Tuskers Kerala\n' playing in the Indian Premier League (IPL) is from Kerala. Kerala is home of the football clubs Kerala Blasters\n, Viva Kerala\nand FC Kochin\n.","Kerala also has an indigenous ancient solar calendar — the Malayalam calendar\n— which is used in various communities primarily for timing agricultural and religious activities.","The elephants\nare an integral part of the culture and daily life in Kerala. These Indian elephants\nare given a prestigious place in the state's culture. They are often christened names by which they're known across the entire state. Elephants in Kerala are often referred to as the 'sons of the sahya\n'\nand are indispensable for temple festivals. The elephant is the state animal of Kerala and is featured on the emblem of the Government of Kerala\n.","Sarpa Kavu\n(meaning Sacred Grove of the Serpent\n) is a typically small traditional grove of trees seen in the Kerala\nstate of South India\n. These pristine groves usually have representations of several Naga Devatas\n(serpent gods\n), which were worshipped by the joint families or taravads\n. This was part of Nagaradhana\n(snake worship) which was prevalent among Keralites\nduring past centuries. It had been practised by Thiyyas, Perumannans, Nairs\n, Arayas\nand many other tribal, non-tribal and coastal communities all over the Malabar Coast\nin South India\n. snake was considered as god and the people worshipped on them for getting blessings","Kerala\nhas a large number of temples. The temples celebrate annual festivals which are not only unique to the region but sometimes have features that are unique to each temple. Each temple describes each interesting history behind its creation. In the Malabar, distinct art form called Theyyam\nattract tourists, and mini carnivals are also held along with temple festivals. Temple festivals are taken up with great pride by the residents and patrons of the temple and celebrated with much ado."]},"downloaded":true},"d18":{"_id":{"$oid":"5a86b1c50262df3c25390fcc"},"title":"/wiki/Demographics_of_Kerala","content":{"title":"Demographics of Kerala","rels":["/wiki/UAE","/wiki/United_States","/wiki/KSA","/wiki/Oman","/wiki/Qatar","/wiki/Kuwait","/wiki/Bahrain","/wiki/United_Kingdom","/wiki/Non-Municipal_Census_Towns_in_Kerala","/wiki/Sangam_period","/wiki/Edakkal_Caves","/wiki/Ariyannur_Umbrellas","/wiki/Kudakkallu_Parambu","/wiki/Chovvanur_burial_cave","/wiki/Chera_dynasty","/wiki/Venad","/wiki/Kerala_school_of_astronomy_and_mathematics","/wiki/Battle_of_Colachel","/wiki/Anglo-Mysore_Wars","/wiki/Battle_of_Quilon","/wiki/Vaikom_Satyagraham","/wiki/Cochin_Royal_Family","/wiki/Malabar_Migration","/wiki/List_of_Kerala_State_Government_Organizations","/wiki/List_of_Chief_Ministers_of_Kerala","/wiki/List_of_Governors_of_Kerala","/wiki/Kerala_Legislative_Assembly","/wiki/Local_Body_Election_in_Kerala","/wiki/Saptakakshi_Munnani","/wiki/United_Front_(Kerala)","/wiki/Left_Democratic_Front_(Kerala)","/wiki/United_Democratic_Front_(Kerala)","/wiki/List_of_politicians_of_Kerala","/wiki/Agasthyamala_Biosphere_Reserve","/wiki/Ashtamudi_Lake","/wiki/Kerala_Backwaters","/wiki/Districts_of_Kerala","/wiki/Eravikulam_National_Park","/wiki/Flora_and_fauna_of_Kerala","/wiki/Malabar_Coast","/wiki/Marayoor","/wiki/Nelliampathi","/wiki/Nilgiri_Biosphere_Reserve","/wiki/Nilgiris_(mountains)","/wiki/Palakkad_Gap","/wiki/Protected_areas_of_Kerala","/wiki/Vembanad_Lake","/wiki/Malayali","/wiki/Namboothiri_Brahmin","/wiki/Ambalavasi","/wiki/Samanta_Kshatriya","/wiki/Nair","/wiki/Saint_Thomas_Christians","/wiki/Kerala_Iyers","/wiki/Ezhava","/wiki/Cochin_Jews","/wiki/Jainism_in_Kerala","/wiki/Pulayar","/wiki/Dravidian_people","/wiki/Muslim_Mappila","/wiki/Adivasi","/wiki/List_of_Scheduled_Tribes_in_India#Kerala","/wiki/Kerala_model","/wiki/Tourism_in_Kerala","/wiki/Education_in_Kerala","/wiki/Colleges_in_Kerala","/wiki/Arts_of_Kerala","/wiki/Architecture_of_Kerala","/wiki/Cuisine_of_Kerala","/wiki/Kalarippayattu","/wiki/Malayalam_literature","/wiki/Sarpam_Thullal","/wiki/Triumvirate_poets_of_modern_Malayalam","/wiki/Vallam_Kali","/wiki/Kathakali","/wiki/Kolkali","/wiki/Koodiyattam","/wiki/Mohiniyattam","/wiki/Margamkali","/wiki/Ottamthullal","/wiki/Theyyam","/wiki/Malayalam_cinema","/wiki/Vishu","/wiki/Onam","/wiki/Pooram","/wiki/Malayalam","/wiki/Malayalam_calendar","/wiki/Mappila_dialect_of_Malayalam","/wiki/Suriyani_Malayalam","/wiki/Judeo-Malayalam","/wiki/Irula_language","/wiki/Chenda","/wiki/Thayambaka","/wiki/Kolkali","/wiki/Panchari_melam","/wiki/Panchavadyam","/wiki/Sopanam","/wiki/Nair_Service_Society","/wiki/SNDP","/wiki/Alappuzha#Commerce_and_tourism","/wiki/Athirappilly_Falls","/wiki/Beaches_in_Kerala","/wiki/Bekal","/wiki/Kerala_Backwaters","/wiki/Kollam#Tourism.2C_Places_of_interest_and_historical_significance","/wiki/Islands_of_Kollam","/wiki/Kovalam","/wiki/Munnar","/wiki/Estuaries_of_Paravur","/wiki/Visitor_attractions_in_Thrissur","/wiki/Tourism_in_Thiruvananthapuram","/wiki/Vallam_Kali","/wiki/Wayanad","/wiki/Demographics_of_Kerala","/wiki/Demographics_of_Kerala"],"contents":["Kerala\nis a state in south-western India. Most of Kerala\n's 33.3\u0026#160;million people (in 2011) are of Malayali\n(Malayalam language\nspeaking) ethnicity. Most of the Malayalam and English speaking Keralites derive their ancestry from Dravidian\nand Aryan\ncommunities that settled in Kerala and intermixed with each other and existing populations.[1]\n\nAdditional ancestries derive from several centuries of contact with non-Indian lands, whereby people of Arab\n, Jewish\n, and other ethnicities settled in Kerala. Many of these immigrants intermarried\nwith native Malayalam speakers.[2]\n\n[3]\n\nA tiny number of Muslims thus take lineage from Arab settlers mixed with local population.","Malayalam\nis Kerala's official language\nand is spoken by at least 96% of the people of Kerala; the next most common languages are Hindi\nand Tamil\n, spoken mainly by migrant\nworkers from North and eastern parts of India and also from the neighbouring state of Tamil Nadu. Tulu\nand Kannada\nis spoken in most parts of the northern district of Kasaragod, adjoining Karnataka\n. In addition, Kerala is home to 321,000 indigenous tribal Adivasis\n\n(1.10% of the populace).[4]\n\nSome 63% of tribals reside in the eastern districts of Wayanad (where 35.82% are tribals), Palakkad (1.02%), and Idukki (15.66%).[5]\n\nThese groups, including the Irulars, Kurumbars\n, and Mudugars,[6]\n\nspeak their own native languages.[7]\n\n[8]\n\n[9]\n\nCholanaikkan\ntribe in the Silent Valley National Park\nwere contacted\nonly in the 1970s and they are the most isolated tribe in the state.","","","Kerala is home to 2.76% of India's people, and — at 859 persons per km²;[10]\n\nits land is three times as densely settled as the rest of India. However, Kerala's population growth rate\nis far lower than the national average. Whereas Kerala's population more than doubled between 1951 and 1991 — adding 15.6\u0026#160;million people to reach a total of 29.1\u0026#160;million residents in 1991 — the population stood at 31.8 million by 2001 and 33.3 million in 2011.[10]\n\nKerala's people are most densely settled in the coastal region, leaving the eastern hills and mountains comparatively sparsely populated.[11]\n\n","Hinduism\nis followed by the majority of Keralites (54.7%).Kerala is home to Hindu saints and swamis of all castes. Jagatguru Sree Adi Shankaracharya, Sree Narayana Guru, Sree Chattambi Swamikal and Vaikunda Swami were the first among the saints of Kerala. The major religions followed in Kerala are Hinduism\n(54.7% — Hinduism of Kerala\n), Islam\n(26.6%) and Christianity\n(18.4%).[12]\n\nKerala also had a tiny Jewish population\nuntil recently, said to date from 587 BC when they fled the occupation of Jerusalem\nby Nebuchadnezzar\n.[13]\n\nThe 2001 Indian census recorded only 51 Jews in Kerala. The synagogue\nin Kochi\nis the oldest in the Commonwealth of Nations\n. The state has many famous Temples\n, Mosques\n, and Churches\n. The oldest church in India is found in Kerala, believed to be established by St. Thomas the disciple of Jesus Christ and the first Mosque in India as well.","Kerala ranks highest in India with respect to social development indices such as elimination of poverty, primary education\nand healthcare. This resulted from significant efforts begun in 1911 by the erstwhile Princely states of Cochin\nand Travancore\nto boost healthcare and education among the people and aided by the Christian missionaries. This central focus — unusual in India — was then maintained after Kerala's post-independence inauguration as a state.[14]\n\nThus, Kerala has the highest literacy rate in India of 93.91% (2011);[15]\n\nand life expectancy is now the highest in India.The suicide rates in Kerala are the highest in India,[16]\n\n. As per the 2011 census, Kerala and Puducherry are the only states in India with a female-to-male ratio\nhigher than 0.99. The ratio for Kerala is 1.084 — 1084 females per 1000 males — while the national figure is 0.940.[17]\n\n.It is also one of the state in India to have sub-replacement fertility\n. [18]\n\nUNICEF\nand the World Health Organization\n(WHO) designated Kerala the world's first \"baby-friendly state\" via its \"Baby Friendly Hospital Initiative\n\". The state is also known for Ayurveda\n, a traditional system of medicine\n— this traditional expertise is currently drawing increasing numbers of medical tourists\n. However, drawbacks to this situation includes the population's steady aging — indeed, 11.2% of Keralites are age 60 or over.[14]\n\n","Kerala's unusual socioeconomic and demographic situation was summarized by author\nand environmentalist\nBill McKibben\n:[19]\n\n","Kerala, a state in India, is a bizarre anomaly among developing nations, a place that offers real hope for the future of the Third World. Though not much larger than Maryland, Kerala has a population as big as California's and a per capita annual income of less than $300 mn dollar. But its infant mortality rate is very low, its literacy rate among the highest on Earth, and its birthrate below America's and falling faster. Kerala's residents live nearly as long as Americans or Europeans. Though mostly a land of paddy-covered plains, statistically Kerala stands out in social development; there's truly no place like it.","As of 2011, a total of 2,280,000 Keralites reside outside India. Largest populations are found in UAE (883,313) and USA (680,076).[20]\n\n","As of 2011, the major concentrations of expat Keralites are in the following nations:[21]\n\n","There are more than 1,000,000 migrants living in Kerala,[22]\n\nmostly from Assam\nand West Bengal\n, constituting more than 8% of the population. There are also migrants from Bihar, Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh, Orissa, and the North East.[23]\n\nIn some places like Perumbavoor\nthey outnumber the locals.[24]\n\nSome alarmist have even wrote that \"of late, Kerala has been hearing more Bengali\nthan its own local language\"\n,[25]\n\nwhich is a huge exaggeration, since there are very few migrants in Northern and Southern Kerala. Most of the migrants tend to concentrate around central Kerala, especially in Kochi\n(Notable exceptions would be Thiruvananthapuram\nand Kozhikode\n. In Kozhikode, northern immigrants constitute more than 8% of the total population, at 35,000).[22]\n\n","Studies indicate that by the time of 2016 state elections\n, migrants will become a crucial voting block in many of the constituencies in Thiruvananthapuram, Kochi, Kozhikode, Thrissur and Kannur.[26]\n\n","The following is a list of most populous urban agglomerations\nin the Kerala\nstate of India.

For that, see List of most populous cities in India\n.","Kerala has seven million-plus cities: Kochi\n, Kozhikode\n, Thrissur\n, Malappuram\n, Thiruvananthapuram\n, Kannur\nand Kollam\n.

In addition, as of early 2013 there are close to 2.5 million (7.5% of state population) migrant workers from other states of India in Kerala.[34]\n\n","The Scheduled Caste (SC) population of Kerala State is 3,123,941 which is 9.8% of overall population. Scheduled Tribes in Kerala with a population of 3.64 lakh constitute 1.14% of the population of state. Denominations groups among Christians [40]\n\n","Catholic church (Syrian and Latin rites) is the largest denomination among Kerala Christians. Malankara orthodox church, Jacobite Syrian orthodox church and Marthomite Syrian church denominations claim Syrian roots. Major Protestant groups are: Church of South India(C.S.I.) and various Pentecostal churches are major Protestant churches.Chaldean, Seventh Day Adventists, Salvation army etc. are some of the other denominations. Denominations should not be considered as caste or ethnic groups. Caste groups among Christians, which is a continuation of casteism in Hinduism, runs parallel to denominational divisions. One caste group may be spread over many denominations. One denomination may have more than one caste group in it. Person belonging to a denomination can convert to another denomination.

the thirteenth largest economy\nin India. Service industry\ndominates the Kerala\neconomy. Kerala's per capita GDP in 2013-14 is Rs. 103820.[3]\n\nKerala's low GDP and productivity figures juxtaposed with higher development figures than in most Indian states is often dubbed the \"Kerala Phenomenon\n\" or the \"Kerala Model\n\" of development by economists, political scientists, and sociologists. This phenomenon arises mainly from Kerala's land reforms, social upliftment of entire communities and reforms introduced by the communist party which held the state for a long period of time.[4]\n\nSome describe Kerala's economy as a \"democratic socialist\nwelfare state\n\". Some, such as Financial Express, use the term \"Money Order Economy\".[5]\n\nKerala's economic progress is above the national average, but relatively few major corporations and manufacturing plants are headquartered in Kerala. Estimates of the 2013 Tendulkar Committee Report on poverty suggest that percentages of population below poverty line in rural and urban Kerala are 9.14% and 4.97%","Around 3,000,000 Keralites are working abroad, mainly in Persian Gulf\n; to where migration started with the Gulf Boom\n. The Kerala Economy is therefore largely dependent on trade in services and resulted remittances\n.[6]\n\n[7]\n\n[8]\n\nIn 2012, the state was the highest receiver of overall remittances to India\nwhich stood at Rs.49,965 Crore (31.2% of the State's GDP), followed by Tamil Nadu, Punjab and Uttar Pradesh.[9]\n\nS. Irudaya Rajan describes the situation as \"Remittances from global capitalism are carrying the whole Kerala economy\".[6]\n\nWith 11.8% of the labour force unemployed in 2015, Kerala is 11th in unemployment in India.[10]\n\nUnderemployment\n, low employability of youths, and a 13.5% female participation rate\nare chronic issues.[11]\n\n:5, 13\n\n[12]\n\nThe 'Report on Fifth Annual Employment - Unemployment Survey for 2015-16' prepared by the labour bureau of the Union ministry of labour and employment indicates that Tripura had the highest unemployment rate of 19.7% in India, followed by Sikkim (18.1%) and Kerala (12.5%).","","","This is a chart of trend of gross state domestic product of Kerala at market prices estimated\nby Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation\nwith figures in millions of Indian Rupees.Kerala had recorded a growth rate of 6.49 per cent in 2013, which was above the national average (4.04) and the second highest among South Indian States. The state’s growth rate was above that of Karnataka (5.79 per cent) and Andhra Pradesh (5.97 per cent).","The state's debt was estimated at 29.53 per cent of GDP in 2013.[14]\n\nState's debt liability recorded an increase of 14.4 per cent and rose from Rs 1,24,081 crore in 2013-14 to Rs 1,41,947 crore in 2014-15. This liability as a percentage of GSDP was 31.4 per cent, which is higher than the target of 29.8 per cent fixed in the Kerala Fiscal Responsibility Act.[15]\n\n","Kerala produces 97% of national output of pepper\nand accounts for 85% of the area under natural rubber\nin the country.[16]\n\nCoconut\n, tea, coffee, cashew\n, and spices\n— including cardamom\n, vanilla\n, cinnamon\n, and nutmeg\n— comprise a critical agricultural sector. A key agricultural staple is rice, with some six hundred varieties grown in Kerala's extensive paddy fields.[17]\n\nNevertheless, home gardens\ncomprise a significant portion of the agricultural sector. Related animal husbandry\nis also important, and is touted by proponents as a means of alleviating rural poverty and unemployment among women, the marginalised, and the landless. Feeding, milking, breeding, management, health care, and concomitant micro-enterprises all provide work for around 3.2\u0026#160;million of Kerala's 5.5\u0026#160;million households.[citation needed\n\n\n]\nThe state government seeks to promote such activity via educational campaigns and the development of new cattle breeds such as Sunandini\n.","The most essential or the staple crop is the rice or paddy. About 600 varieties of rice are grown in the sprawling paddy fields of Kerala. In fact the Kuttanad region of the district of Kerala is known as the 'rice bowl of the state' and enjoys a significant status in the production of rice.","Next to rice is Tapioca and is cultivated mainly in the drier regions. Tapioca is a major food of the Keralites. Besides production of the main crop, Kerala is also a major producer of spices that form the cash crops of the state.The important spices are cardamom, cinnamon, clove, turmeric, nutmeg and vanilla.","Other cash crops that constitute the agricultural sector include tea, coffee cashew, pulses, areca nut, ginger and coconut. In fact coconut provides the principal source of income in Kerala- from coir industry to coconut shell artifacts. Cashew is also an essential cash crop. Kottayam district has extensive areas producing and processing rubber. Apart from rubber, other plantation crop likes plantains or bananas are also grown in plenty.","National Sample Survey Organization (NSSO) conducted a Situation Assessment Survey in 2013. According to their data, as opposed to 57.8% of national households declaring themselves as agricultural, 27.3% did so in Kerala. And of those households in Kerala, nearly two-thirds earn income from activities other than agriculture.When statistics sum up the state earns 30 percent of its income from agriculture.","In 1960-61, Kerala contributed to nearly 70% of the country’s coconut production. In 2011-12, it was at 42%. It dropped further by 2.3% points the next year. According to the State Planning Board (2011) data, the state is producing only about 12% of its total requirement for rice. In 1960-61 Kerala produced more than 10 lakh tons of rice. By 2012-13 rice production was down to 5.08 lakh tons. By 2012-13, in just a single year, area under rice cultivation had declined by 5.2%, and the production itself dropped by 10.2%.","The government enforces state monopoly over liquor sale in the state, after the state banned foreign liquor shops, through the government owned Kerala State Beverages Corporation (KSBC)\n. Every year, liquor sales have been rising and the total sales of liquor and beer during 2010-11 fiscal year was expected to be about Rs. 67\u0026#160;billion.[18]\n\n","The government applies the highest state tax on liquor (around 120%). The total revenue from taxes on liquor was Rs. 55.39\u0026#160;billion in 2009-10. Rum\nand brandy\nare the preferred drinks in Kerala in a country where whisky\noutsells every other liquor. Taxes on alcohol was a major source of revenue for the state government, but of late, it has been showing a declining trend. Only 4.2% of revenues for its annual budget come from liquor sales. Revenues from alcohol to the state's exchequer have registered a 100% rise over the past four years.[19]\n\n","Liquor sales stood at 201 lakh cases worth Rs.11,577 crore during 2015-16, down from 220 lakh cases worth Rs.10,013 crore during the previous year. Gross sales during the first three months of 2016 were around Rs.4,000 crore.[20]\n\n","Kerala is an established tourist destination for both Indians and non-Indians alike. Tourism contributes to nearly 10% of the state's GSDP. Tourists mostly visit, Fort Kochi\n, Mattanchery\n, Cherai\n, Kappad\n, Kovalam, the hill stations\nof Munnar\n, Nelliampathi\n, Wayanad\nand Ponmudi\n, and national parks and wildlife sanctuaries such as Periyar\nand Eravikulam National Park\n. The \"backwaters\n\" region – an extensive network of interlocking rivers, lakes, and canals that center on Veli\n, Akkulam\n, Ashtamudi\n, Alleppey\n, Kumarakom\n, and Punnamada – also see heavy tourist traffic. Examples of Keralite architecture, such as the Padmanabhapuram Palace\n, Malik Deenar Mosque\nKasaragod\n, Paradesi Synagogue\nare also visited.

As of 2008, the Gulf countries altogether have a Keralite population of more than 2.5 million, who send home annually a sum of USD\n9.25 billion,[22]\n\nwhich is more than 15.13% of Remittance to India in 2008\n. Large numbers work in construction. High literacy allows Keralites to secure administrative employment \u0026amp; white collar jobs. Foreign remittances augment the state's economic output by nearly 25 percent. Migrants' families are three times as likely as those of nonmigrants to live in superior housing, and about twice as likely to have telephones, refrigerators and cars.[23]\n\nPathanamthitta\nand Thrissur\ndistricts have on an average one member from each household a non-resident Indian.","Of the $71 billion in remittances sent to India in 2012, Kerala still received the highest among the states: $11.3 billion, which is nearly 16%.[24]\n\n","The survey conducted by the Centre for Development Studies (CDS), Thiruvananthapuram, in 2016 pointed out that foreign remittances in Kerala in 2014 was estimated to be Rs. 71,142 crores which dropped to Rs.63,289 crores in 2016.","According to a study commissioned by the Kerala State Planning Board\n, the state should look for other reliable sources instead of relying on remittances to finance its expenditure.[25]\n\n","Kerala is the single largest originator of education loans for the country as a whole.Total disbursal of education loans amount to Rs. 60\u0026#160;billion.[26]\n\n","Kerala has 145,704\u0026#160;km of roads (4.2% of India's total). This translates into about 4.62\u0026#160;km of road per thousand population, compared to an all-India average of 2.59\u0026#160;km. Virtually all of Kerala's villages are connected by road. Traffic in Kerala has been growing at a rate of 10–11% every year, resulting in high traffic and pressure on the roads. Total road length in Kerala increased by 5% between 2003-2004. The road density in Kerala is nearly four times the national average, and is a reflection of Kerala's unique settlement patterns. India's national highway network includes a Kerala-wide total of 1,524\u0026#160;km, which is only 2.6% of the national total. There are eight designated national highways in the state. Upgrading and maintenance of 1,600\u0026#160;km of state highways and major district roads have been taken up under the Kerala State Transport Project (KSTP), which includes the GIS\n-based Road Information and Management Project (RIMS).

importance and antiquity of education in Kerala\nis underscored by the state's ranking as among the most literate in the country. The local dynastic precursors of modern-day Kerala\n- primarily the Travancore Royal Family, the Christian missionaries, The Nair Service Society\n,[1]\n\nSree Narayana Dharma Paripalana\nYogam[2]\n\n(SNDP Yogam) and Muslim Educational Society\n(MES)[3]\n\n- made significant contributions to the progress on education in Kerala.[4]\n\nThere were many sabha mathams\nthat imparted Vedic\nknowledge. Apart from kalaris\n, which taught martial arts, there were village schools run by Ezhuthachans or Asans. Christian missionaries brought the modern school education system to Kerala.","Education in Kerala had been promoted during British rule in India by Christian\nmissionaries who were keen on providing education to all sections of society and on strengthening of women, without any kind of discrimination. The contributions of Catholic priests and nuns has been crucial and has played a major role in the education of women and members of lower strata of society, resulting in the surpassing of many social hurdles. A significant figure in the 19th century was Rev.fr. Kuriakose Elias Chavara\n,[5]\n\nwho started a system called \"A school along with every church\" to make education available for both poor and rich. That system still continues in the present. His work has resulted in the promotion of education for girls and has become a model for the educational system in Kerala after independence. Kerala's high literacy rate is attributed to a high literacy rate among girls; as it is said, \"When a woman is educated, she will make sure that her children are well-educated.\"","The Kerala school of astronomy and mathematics\nwas founded by Madhava of Sangamagrama in Kerala, which included among its members: Parameshvara\n, Neelakanta Somayaji\n, Jyeshtadeva\n, Achyuta Pisharati\n, Melpathur Narayana Bhattathiri\nand Achyuta Panikkar\n. The school flourished between the 14th and 16th centuries and the original discoveries of the school seems to have ended with Narayana Bhattathiri\n(1559–1632). In attempting to solve astronomical problems, the Kerala school independently created a number of important mathematics concepts. Their most important results—series expansion for trigonometric functions—were described in Sanskrit verse in a book by Neelakanta\ncalled Tantrasangraha\n\n, and again in a commentary on this work, called Tantrasangraha-vakhya\n, of unknown authorship. The theorems were stated without proof, but proofs for the series for sine, cosine, and inverse tangent were provided a century later in the work Yuktibha?a\n(c.1500-1610), written in Malayalam, by Jyesthadeva\n, and also in a commentary on Tantrasangraha\n.","Their work, completed two centuries before the invention of calculus in Europe\n, provided what is now considered the first example of a power series (apart from geometric series). However, they did not formulate a systematic theory of differentiation and integration, nor is there any direct evidence of their results being transmitted outside Kerala.","","","Schools and colleges are mostly run by the government, private trusts, or individuals. Each school is affiliated with either the Indian Certificate of Secondary Education\n(ICSE), the Central Board for Secondary Education\n(CBSE), Kerala State Education Board\nor the (NIOS). English is the language of instruction in most private schools, while government run schools offer English or Malayalam as the medium of instruction. Government run schools in the districts bordering Karnataka and Tamil Nadu also offer instruction in Kannada or Tamil languages. A handful of Government Sanskrit Schools provide instruction in Sanskrit supplemented by Malayalam, English, Tamil or Kannada. After 10 years of secondary schooling, students typically enroll at Higher Secondary School\nin one of the three streams—liberal arts\n, commerce\nor science\n. Upon completing the required coursework, students can enroll in general or professional degree programmes. Kerala topped the Education Development Index (EDI) among 21 major states in India in year 2006-2007.[6]\n\nIn January 2016, Kerala became the 1st Indian state to achieve 100% primary education through its literacy programme Athulyam.[7]\n\n","In spite of the large number of educational institutions in the state, the quality of education at all levels in Kerala has been showing a decline due to financial constraints resulting from quantitative expansion of the sector.[8]\n\n","A study published in 1999 by the Centre for Socio-economic \u0026amp; Environmental Studies states that while the dropout rates are very low in primary schools, the same increases in the ninth and the tenth standards in Kerala. This is particularly true of SC/ST students. Schools showed that only 73% of the students joining at 1st Standard reach the 10th Standard. In the case of scheduled caste students, only 59% reach the 10th standard. 60% of Scheduled Tribe students drop out by the 10th standard.[9]\n\n","Another major indicator of the inefficiency of Kerala's school education system is the large-scale failure of the students in the matriculation examination. Only about 50% of the students who appear for the examination get through. The percentage has been considerably increased because of major interventions by the government in the areas of curriculum and teacher training. In March 2011, 91.37% students qualified for higher studies in the matriculation Examination.The grades in SSLC examination plays an important role in the admission procedure to colleges in Kerala. [10]\n\n","The schools and colleges in Kerala are run by the government or private trusts and individuals. Each school is affiliated with either the Indian Certificate of Secondary Education\n(ICSE), the Central Board for Secondary Education\n(CBSE), Kerala State Education Board\nor the National Institute of Open Schooling\n(NIOS).
